0," For those needing emergency assistance please use the Chat Available Here(If your birth control failed or was incorrectly taken within the last five days, you have several Emergency Contraception options   Copper IUD( The Copper IUD is the most effective EC (99 effective), if placed within five days of unprotected sex."
1,Unfortunately there are myths about IUDs.
2,"( If you have a higher BMI, the Copper IUD is your best choice as the other methods are less effective for women with a higher BMIs."
3,Cost?
4,"In the USA 100 covered by insurance(  New evidence shows a hormonal IUD can also be used as emergency contraception in addition to the copper IUD, but please ask your doctor for their advice."
5,"Be cautious, as it is a newer EC option."
6,"Plan B This method is most effective when used within 72 hours after having unprotected sex, however, the sooner the better."
7,It is available over the counter or online without a prescription in many countries.
8,It is a high dose of progestin which will prevent ovulation.
9,"Please note, studies have found that women with a BMI over 25 had an increased risk of a pregnancy when using Plan B."
10,"Cost at Walmart(      Cost at Amazon(      The FDA said since Plan B prevents pregnancy by acting on ovulation, well before implantation, it does not cause abortions."
11,Tldr It only prevents ovulation and does not prevent implantation.
12,See FDA announcement(    Ella( This method is most effective when used within 5 days of unprotected sex.
13,"You will need a prescription (Planned Parenthood, Urgent Care, Emergency Room, etc) to get it, but it can also be obtained online( Ella acts to suppress progesterone."
14,Ella delays ovulation.
15,"Please note, while Ella is a better choice than Plan B for women with a higher BMI, studies have found that women with a higher BMI had an increased risk of a pregnancy when using Ella."
16,"Please also note, Ella can make hormonal birth control less effective (as it suppresses progestin), so use a backup barrier method for at least 7 days to one month after taking it."
17,Cost?
18,(   Yuzpe Method( This method is most effective when used within 72 hours after having unprotected sex.
19,The Yuzpe method is two higher doses of regular birth control pills.
20,"By taking multiple pills in a specific order, the estrogen and progestin in those pills work to prevent ovulation."
21,"However, this method has a higher chance of side effects because it is progestin and estrogen."
22,Myths Concerning Emergency Contraception Pills     Does it cause an abortion?
23,"No, some people confuse Emergency Contraception Pills with abortion pills."
24,"ECPs prevent pregnancy by delaying ovulation, so nothing gets fertilized."
25,Studies show that ECPs are not effective if a woman has already ovulated.
26,"Remember Emergency Contraception is important, in part, because sperm live in and around the fallopian tubes for days waiting for an egg to appear (around 5 days)."
27,"Thats why ECPs only work for up to 5 days after sex, and why its important to take them as soon as you can."
28,Can I have unprotected sex again?
29,No.
30,ECPs only protect you against one act of unprotected sex.
31,"If you have unprotected sex again after taking ECPs, youre increasing your risk of a pregnancy."
32,Will they affect future fertility?
33,No.
34,There is no evidence anywhere that they affect future fertility.
35,"The main risk is unintended pregnancies as ECPs are much less effective than many other methods of birth control (IUD, Implant, Pill, etc.)"
36,But whats MY Pregnancy Risk?
37,It is impossible to calculate the pregnancy risk for each individual unprotected sexual act.
38,So we can't tell you that.
39,But...
40,"If you missed a pill, start with your specific pill instruction guide."
41,"If you lost it, many are available online."
42,"If after searching you still can't find it, this is a short guide( The tldr is any missed pill near the placebo/inactive/no pills can raise your risk for pregnancy."
43,"Bleeding( or lack there of( while on hormonal birth control is not an indication of pregnancy, it is just possible side effect."
44,"If the condom broke, but you used withdrawal, then start here."
45,"( The tldr is that withdrawal can prevent pregnancy in most cases, but even withdrawal rockstars can get pregnant."
46,Only a pregnancy test can rule out pregnancy.
47,"Typically, the most reliable way to test is to test 21 days after the unprotected sex act, and again 7 days after that."
48,"Remember, use the first pee of the day."
49,"For a link to very cheap tests, check out the example in the sidebar.I'm on hormonal birthcontrol but no bleed this month?Again, bleeding( or lack there of( while on hormonal birth control is not an indication of pregnancy, it is just a possible side effect."
50,Are you on the combo pill?
51,The monthly bleed is not a pregnancy indication.
52,Really.
53,it was just a marketing tactic to get women to try the pill in the 1970s and because one of the doctors was Catholic.
54,Lack of a 'withdrawal bleed' (what the bleed is called) is very common because the pill thins your lining.
55,Thin lining  less bleeding (which can even mean no bleeding).
56,And most doctors / researchers now want the placebo pills shortened or removed altogether as they can reduce ovarian suppression (impact effectiveness).
57,"So do not worry unless a mistake happened (missed pill, IUD misplacement discovered after string check, etc)."
58,Good post!
59,Glad it'll be a sticky to address some of the common concerns people have.
60,"(But FYI, Ella appears to start to lose effectiveness at bmi 35."
61,( which is why it's a little more ideal if you're overweight/obese and can't/wont use copper IUD.)

181,"Well, yesterday afternoon I got the copper iud inserted, it wasn't that painful really and after an hour I was just fine, so much so that last night I had unprotected sex."
182,But now I'm kinda worried if I should take an emergency pill or no.
183,"My doctor told me after the insertion that the copper iud is effective as soon as you place it and never said anything about not having sex, but I feel like a should have asked, I totally forgot at the moment."
184,"Also I tried feeling the strings and I really didn't feel anything, neither my partner."
185,I would appreciate your comments.
186,Youre protected.
187,I was told to wait 24 hours but that was more of a comfort thing as something was just inserted.
188,Can you feel your cervix actual by the way?
189,Its like a little protruding knob with a small indent in the middle.
190,Sometimes it can be further always be harder to reach.
191,During your menstrual cycle its much lower
192,"Copper IUD works as emergency contraception, so you're protected from pregnancy the minute it goes in."
193,"However, I believe there's an increased risk of infection in the first few days after insertion, so I'd maybe avoid it for that reason."
194,"As an aside, the first day wasn't my worst, the cramping and bleeding were worse for me after 23 days, then resolved, so you may have some more ouchy days ahead."
195,You were protected
196,Paraguard is effective immediately.
197,However it is more common for it to move within the first month.
198,If it is not in the right position it can be an issue.
199,Also I was told not to insert anything for 48 hours after.

224,For context I have a history of PTSD and sexual violence and abuse.
225,"My hormonal birth control (Yaz) was giving me a lot of issues, and I wanted to try an IUD so I could have local, rather than systemic, release of hormones."
226,"My gynecologist initially recommended me to do an IUD under twilight sedation, due to my history of abuse."
227,"However, insurance wont pay for it, and the cost of the procedure would put me in an insane amount of medical debt."
228,"My gynecologist recommended a Xanax, Norco (hydrocodone (an opioid)  acetaminophen), and a Tylenol for the procedure instead, but Im still freaking out about how painful and invasive the procedure could be."
229,"Ive tried calling other gynecologists in the area to ask what pain management techniques their doctors provide, but a lot of the offices Ive tried to talk to either say they dont offer pain management or wont tell me what type of pain mqanagement they could provide."
230,"Theyve been unbelievably unhelpful and rude, and I dont feel like I have any other options."
231,My question for the group I was curious if other people had done an IUD placement with similar medications.
232,Was an anxiety medication and an opioid enough?

238,I would highly recommend also asking for a cervical softening medication and a cervical block.
239,Its still quite painful and shocked but it helps
240,Ive been on and off anxious about my birth control pill since I started it 4 months ago.
241,I have bad anxiety about new medications and I have a bit of Tokophobia (fear of pregnancy) and this is my first time on BC and first time being sexually active.
242,I do everything to protect myself.
243,"I take my pill everyday at the same time, Im never late and Ive never missed a day."
244,I also use condoms along with pullout every single time I have sex.
245,I try to keep it within the appropriate temperature range but that is something I am constantly struggling with since the pill is traveling with me from my house to my boyfriends house and his house is not temperature regulated like mine is and its really making me scared that as the colder weather is coming and his house gets freezing that my pill will become ineffective.
246,"For the past couple days, Ive been feeling some pain in my left ovary area and been having some milky white discharge mixed with clear discharge."
247,I had my withdrawal bleed last week too.
248,I always think my pill has become ineffective so now Im ovulating or something when I know I shouldnt be.
249,Im just really paranoid and I dont know why Im feeling ovulation pains only in my left side.
250,I keep thinking my pill got compromised somehow.

258,"I dont think the temperature matters too much, especially with way youre using/transporting it."
259,Youre overthinking which I totally understand.
260,The pain is probably just side effects or leftover effects from the withdrawal bleed?
261,If youre worried Id take a pregnancy test to ease your mind.
262,I went to the doctor on the 14th for something and they did a test and it was negative.
263,I take at least one pregnancy test a month.
264,You should be fine then!
265,"Try to remember that the pill is over 99 effective as your only form of hurts control, and if youre using condoms and/or pullout there is next to zero change of pregnancy!"
266,I'm considering switching from the pill (alysena) to Nexplanon.
267,"I'm wondering if anyone has done this, and what their experience was like with side effects and especially changes in their period."
268,I'm hoping that because Alysena contains progestin I should have little to no side effects since I'm already used to the hormone in Nexplanon.

319,I had unprotected sex and my boyfriend finished inside on Monday the 11th.
320,Up until then I had not missed a pill and took it at the same time consistently.
321,"The following Tuesday, the 12th, I picked up a prescription for my new birth control (was on the combo pill and started the POP) but I had an unexpected medical emergency that evening that landed me in the ER so I did not take my birth control that night as I was unable."
322,"The following Wednesday (the 13th) night, I started the POP, and then three days later on Saturday night (the 16th), I had unprotected sex again."
323,"I started my period that same night and it lasted for about 5 full days (today, the 22nd, is the first day I havent bled).While in the ER they did a lot of blood work and told me I was not pregnant, so I know the pill was working for me while I took it consistently lol."
324,But Im worried that the day that I missed my pill will cause me to get pregnant since I had unprotected sex the night before.
325,"I know the POP is effective after 48 hours of use so Im not worried about the Saturday night (the 16th) that I had sex, Im concerned about the fact that I had sex Monday night and then missed a pill Tuesday night."
326,What are the chances I will get pregnant from doing that?
327,"I started my period that same weekend like I said, so Im not sure if I was even in my fertile window to where I COULDVE gotten pregnant from missing a pill, but Im still a little worried."
328,"You got your period, there is next to zero chance that youre pregnant."

339,Hello all!
340,New to this page.
341,I have endo.
342,My surgery was last year  they removed to massive cysts and my left ovary and tube.
343,I was on Orilissa and norethindrone acetate 5MG after surgery.
344,I stopped the Orilissa 8/2 with little withdrawal symptoms.
345,I stopped the norethindrone on 8/28.
346,Prior to my surgery and a bad year of endo my cycle always came pretty normal and timely.
347,Now I have no idea what to expect!
348,"I had withdrawal bleeding, cramping, etc."
349,8/319/2.
350,"Overall, not too terrible."
351,I know its always a little hard to know what happens to your cycle after stopping BC but Im wondering if anyone has any experience to share?
352,Should I expect my period soon or just wait to see when it pops up?
353,Ive heard differing tales so Im curious to hear from others!
354,Thank you!

360,However the past year I have had very irregular bleeding/periods for two months I had no bleeding at all (heaven!)
361,and then suddenly I am now on week 3 of a constant bleed.
362,"I want to try a few things before switching BC completely bc other than this bleeding, I am very happy with my BC.1) what is the ibuprofen method?2) Ive heard of some women using primrose, can anyone expand on this?3) Ive also heard of some women doubling up on their Cerelle has this worked for anyone?I am in the UK and have been buying my Cerelle through an online pharmacy because it is basically impossible to get a GP appointment, so going at this alone until I can get a GP I guess.Thank you!"

380,"That said, because you had irregular/ infrequent periods in the past, I do think itd be a good idea to see a doctor."
381,"Irregular bleeding does not mean youre infertile, but its a symptom of other medical issues (PCOS, etc.)"
382,I got Kyleena removed 2 days ago  my dr said to expect some bleeding.
383,However during those 2 days it was just light spotting.
384,(I never had a period on the IUD)This morning I woke up to really bad cramps  bright medium to heavey bleeding.
385,It feels like a period BUT my dr said I wouldnt get that for another 46 weeks.Is it possible and normal this could be considered my first period so soon after removal?

394,A couple of months ago I wasnt able to feel my strings and the nurse checked and was able to get them but suggested I have an ultrasound to check!So I had that on the 7th of Sept this month and my period started on the 5th.

401,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
402,Background I got my Paraguard IUD in 2018 after being unsatisfied with hormonal birth control.
403,"My IUD did cause me to get heavier and more painful periods, but not getting pregnant is my one and only concern."
404,"I want the most effective form of birth control, so I am extremely determined to keep it."
405,No doctor is keen on removing a 20something year olds uterus.
406,"Painful periods are not my concern.In May this year, I had my first every ovarian cyst rupture, and I went to the ER for the pain/not knowing what was going on."
407,"Since then, Ive revisited the cysts with a new obgyn with ultrasounds, and one cyst is getting bigger every single time."
408,now at 6x5 when it was 3x3 in 2 months time.
409,"The cysts gives me a low, dull pain on my right ovary."
410,"Every time I visited her, she tells me that the copper IUD caused everything."
411,"My anemia last year, the cysts this year, etc."
412,We havent tested for anything.
413,"I totally understand if it did cause anemia since I am losing a bit of blood every time, but I have other health issues going on as well where a lot of things in my body are extremely low, including iron levels."
414,Am I crazy for wanting to check for other causes before removing it?
415,"Everything I look at says cysts can form in the first year with an IUD, but dissolve over time."
416,"This cyst isnt going away, and its been a few years of having the IUD."
417,"Obviously, if I really have to, I will remove it, but I just cant get over the fact that we dont even try to look at other causes of the cysts."
418,"I am wanting to see a new obgyn, but that will be a few months time on anyones schedule, so I just want to know if this has been an experience for anyone else before I jump the gun."
419,Has anyone had experiences of getting cysts years after insertion with no prior experience with them?
420,Am I making a mistake trying to keep the IUD?
421,The hormonal IUD can cause cysts that go away.
422,"The copper IUD has no hormones, so it shouldn't be causing these issues."
423,"If available to you, I would get a second opinion about the cause of the cysts."
424,I hope you feel better soon.
425,I had a Skyla iud and it caused ovarian cysts.
426,My doctor told me it was the low hormones and getting on a combo pill would help.
427,"However, I get migraines and cant do combo."
428,Im on the mini pill now and the cysts dont bother me anymore.
429,Hi there.
430,Current Paraguard IUD owner (3 years)  as well and nurse.I have had ovarian cysts with my IUD as well.
431,They come and go but over time they have become manageable.
432,"I know when I have one, Ill have the dull, aching, pulling pain you mention but its usually around the time of ovulation for me and over time the pain goes away."
433,"You may not have that with your case, but dont let your doctor convince you that you need to get rid of your IUD."
434,I was turned away by two doctors when I requested to get the copper IUD because of ones belief about what I should do with my reproductive health and the other lied to me about my inability to get the IUD because she didnt want to deal with me having it.
435,The copper IUD doesnt stop things like heavy periods and ovarian cysts and that is a very common reason that OBGYNs like to push artificial hormones on their patients so much.
436,"Because if were quiet about insignificant issues like heavy period and ovarian cysts, their lives are easier.I may be coming off as brash, but Ive been through the ringer with doctors trying to shove hormonal birth control down my throat and Im over it )."
437,Ive had my IUD for 3 years and I am very happy and very unpregnant.
438,"My recommendation, if your OBGYN is making you uncomfortable, look into other doctors."
439,You dont have to disclose that with them either.
440,"I will tell you though, I have NEVER had any luck with resolving my ovarian cyst issue because theyre not viewed as a critical condition unless the cyst happens to overturn your ovary and cut blood supply to your ovary."
441,"At that point, your reproductive health is at risk and thats when doctors are going to be gunggo about helping you."
442,So best of luck to you.
443,"Do not let anyone make decisions for you and if you are pressured at any point, you are 100 free to remove yourself from situations."

452,"Hi, what mini pill are you on?"
453,"Do you like it, and do you have side effects from it?"
454,"I have migraines, and my gynecologist is having me go off the combo pill to the mini pill."
455,I also have anemia and Ive had anemia for a bit of my adult life.
456,I take iron when I can tell my levels are low.
457,Leafy greens can also help with this if you are not looking to take supplements.
458,"As far as the cysts go, try to be aware of foods that may have more hormones in them (dairy, soy, etc)."
459,"Menstrual periods can cause anaemia just by them selves, if the IUD has made her bleeds heavier it's not a stretch that its the 'cause' That said lots of people are anaemic anyway and it's usually fairly easy to sort out unless there's a more serious underlying cause"
460,I dont see anything about this in a trusted medical journal.

505,Im on junel fe 1/20 and it is like yellow pills or yellowish pills and the final week has brown pills
506,"Yes, youre protected during the break so long as you follow the instructions that come with your pill pack"
507,i dont have the little brown pills.
508,my pack is 3 weeks of mini yellow pills  (21 day) and apparently mine works is after the 3rd week i have to take a break from the pills for 7 days then start back up after so i should be starting back up this sunday.
509,Is it a continuous use pill pack?
510,Did your doctor say to take a week break?
511,Because if it doesnt have a break week usually thats a continuous use pack.
512,"yeah my dr along with the pharmacist said there has to be a week break, if u also look it up online it says the 21 day pack pills theres a break after finishing the last pill in the pack"
513,"Yeah I just looked into that, its weird how same brand, same dosage, and some dont have the placebo week pills lol.So yeah like you will be protected on your week break, just make sure to start your next pack on time"
514,"it is odd, all my friends on bc have the brown pills / sugar pills in them and theyre like why do u have such a different pack  but okay good!"
515,thank you )
516,"Yeah, like Ive had some where the placebo week was only like 4 days or some where it was 7."
517,And they had the pills at the end.
518,"But yeah I guess this one is just built different, what luck lmao."
519,"Firstly, this is not about whether or not you personally like/have had success with a copper IUD, so if you just want to say how they ruined your period or hurt getting put in, or any horror stories unrelated to the question, there's lots of other threads I'm sure.NOW."
520,"The copper IUD (and I'm discussing the ""T"") works for ""up to 12 years""."
521,But.
522,Is this true?
523,"I can't find anything that says why they stop working, or even that they do actually stop working, and there's literally nothing about any potential ill effects??"
524,"And for some reason it is really difficult to find much actual information about copper IUDs beyond ""they don't use hormones, copper is a spermicide, might get heavy period, lasts for 12 years"".I've now had mine (Paragard) for 13 years and so far, nothing."
525,"Period still the same, no pregnancy, no nothing."
526,"I have the sneaking suspicious Big Period is not lying but like, just doesn't have the data to say when/if/why/how it does ever stop working."
527,"I belieeeeeeve that the amount of copper gradually decreases over time as it is released, and eventually there may not be enough left to offer sufficient protection."
528,"Im not positive but I think its because theres a finite amount of copper on the IUD, and it decreases over time so after a certain amount of years, there isnt enough copper left to make your uterus as toxic as it needs to be to prevent pregnancy."
529,"As others said, it's because the IUD releases fewer copper ions over time."
530,The amount of copper in the IUD is directly related to effectiveness.
531,"Any foreign body in the uterus makes pregnancy less likely, even without copper, but IUDs made of inert plastic had a failure rate that was too high considering that getting pregnant with an IUD is risky."
532,"It's also compicated to study very long term use of IUDs because most people won't use the same IUD for decades for a variety of reasons (wanting to get pregnant, side effects, another method is a better fit...)."
533,And with people over 40 it would be hard to tell whether they are not pregnant because the old IUD is still working or because of their age.
534,"So maybe Paragard is effective for 15 years, but we don't really know."

539,I think it depends on how fast your body oxidizes the copper on the IUD.
540,This would be interesting to look into.
541,Ive been on the pill for 23 years now but havent been sexually active until lately and I take the pill without the break week so I dont get my period.
542,Some people say that if i stopped taking the pill and got my period that it doesnt show if I could be pregnant since its not a real period.
543,"In that case, is a pregnancy test the only way to check if I were to be pregnant?"
544,"Or is it false about the false period matter, would I just be able to take that break week and get my period to check every once in a while?My docter I had when I got BC didnt really do a good job explaining anything."

560,"Im thinking about trying out the nuvaring rather then continuing the birth control pills, what are peoples opinions of the nuvaring?"
561,I used Nuvaring for years and loved it!
562,I used it continuously so I never got my period.
563,"I loved only having to think about birth control once a month, and I had (basically) zero side effects."
564,I only switched because a yearly ring (Annovera) became available.
565,Everyones experience is different  just because I loved it doesnt mean you will.
566,But I definitely think its worth a shot!
567,Tried it for a month hoping to get rid of the side effects of the pill.
568,"They didn't, so I stopped."
569,But I did like that I didn't have to take a pill everyday anymore.
570,I really wish it worked for me!
571,"It wasn't uncomfortable or anything, although I did remove it during sex."
572,I'd say give it a try if you're thinking about it )
573,I really liked the nuva ring.
574,I had to switch off because I found out Im sensitive to estrogen (migraines)

579,"I usr Annovera, which is similar but uses a different progestin."
580,I love it so much.
581,I love the NuvaRing.
582,The only reason I didnt like it was how awkward it was to insert and take out.
583,"That, and I just didnt trust it for pregnancy prevention."
584,"However, it had little to no side effects which I LOVED."
585,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone would have some insight on whether this is a red flag I (21 F) left my DR feeling really uncomfortable.I went to the doctors last week to get my BC prescription renewed, Ive been on it for 3 years."
586,The first question he asked was do you take this to prevent pregnancy.
587,"I said yes, but also to regulate."
588,Then he asked me if my partners all wore a condom.
589,"I felt taken aback, but I was sure he was probably referring to STDs."
590,"My partner (21 M) have been together for 5 years, are engaged and lost our virginities to each other."
591,"We have both never had any other sexual partners.I responded honestly No, we do not, weve only ever been with each other.The doctor then proceeded to turn around in his chair grab his notebook and bop me lightly on the head with it."
592,"He began to lecture me about unwanted pregnancies, how I needed to tell him to wear one, and was exposing myself as birth control is not 100I felt so uncomfortable, and quickly seethed back that we were engaged."
593,"A baby, while inconvenient right at this moment, wouldnt end either of our worlds we have a plan, and both want kids together."
594,I also am very aware that its not 100.His response?
595,Oh.Quickly he wrote my prescription and I scurried out as fast as I could.
596,"I know I look and am young, but Im also an adult."
597,I was humiliated and felt like a little kid in trouble.
598,Would you go back?
599,Have you ever had a doctor like this?
600,Is this a red flag?!
601,?
602,"Its fine for a doctor to mention the protection benefits of combining condoms with hormonal BC, but the way he did it, theres no way in hell I would ever go back."
603,Ever ever.
604,You do not bop me with objects to emphasize your explanation of the info thats already in my pill leaflet.
605,Man the fact he bopped your head was really weird to me unprofessional and treating you like a kid rather than an adult patient
606,I think that depends on the type of relationship you want with a doctor.
607,I've always found male gyns to be awkward in some way.
608,"The last one I had kept trying to make jokes (not inappropriate ones) while placing my IUD and just awkward small talk, as if he didn't know how to talk to women."
609,"I appreciate a doctor who is casual and can joke around but sometimes I just want you to shut up.Alternatively, the gyn I was seeing before covid closed the office would say things like ""you have a beautiful cervix!"""
610,Pretty weird.
611,And she said she was told not to say it but she said she felt it was important people knew they were clean and healthy lol.
612,She was the nicest cutest old lady and reminded me of my grandma and she would always hug me and really most of the appointments were just conversation about life.
613,But I've known her since I was 12 and my grandpa is a well known doctor in the same hospital system so we usually get treated funny anyway.
614,"If someone makes you uncomfortable, don't go back."
615,"You can anonymously report your encounter with him but unless he does that to everyone, he will know it was you when HR talks to him about professionalism."
616,If seeing him again is a fear at least (like just seeing him not actually having an appointment).
617,It's not like he's going to talk to you or anything if you happen to be near him again.
618,You can also state that in your report in case you go to the same office but see a different doctor.
619,Definitely a red flag.
620,It's pretty standard for doctors to discuss condom use and the possibility that birth control could fail.
621,"But with correct use the pill is very effective, so the doctor shouldn't have told you that you have to use condoms or you will get pregnant."
622,"He especially shouldn't have told you that in that condescending wayThere are some situations in which doubling up with condoms is definitely recommended, like if you take a medication that could make the pill less effective and/or harm a fetus if you do end up pregnant."
623,But the doctor would still have handled it poorly even in that case.
624,"Also, I understand why you felt like you had to do it, but you shouldn't have had to explain that you are engaged and want kids in the future."
625,"Even if a patient is in a new or unstable relationship or doesn't want children ever, if they are aware of their birth control options and are OK with their current method's effectiveness the doctor should respect that."
626,Write a review about this doctor SMH sorry that happened to yog

647,"Also I had taken a pregnancy test recently and there was only one line on the T side, does this mean the test didnt work?"

658,the one i used was errored
659,"Yea of the one you took, if you want to get a second pair of eyes."
660,It does sound invalid though.
661,"Sadly i deleted the photo but im very sure it was invalid, the kit says that the results are only valid after 35 minutes of waiting, after 5 minutes the results arent accurate anymore."
662,when it hit 3 minutes there was no line at all and at about 45 mins there appeared only one line on the T side
663,"Okay, retest following the timeline i mentioned above."
664,You can also just test around once a month or so since youre on the pill.
665,You dont need to worry too much about pregnancy.
666,"For about 3 days im being sick (first day I took an extra pill)....after that on day 2 getting diarrhea around 400 and didn't take an extra birth control pill (always take them every evening at 2130), because after 3 or 4 ours it should be in your system."
667,Already told my boyfriend that I wanted to use extra protection just to be sure (condoms).Now I've touched him (there was precum on my hand)...stopped for 4 a 6 minutes to get lube and after that touched myself...So can you get pregnant form all this?
668,"Probably a silly question, but I have a little scare right now."
669,"Okay, so first things first, youre okay."
670,"I would  read through what Im gonna say, for you to determine if you need to skip your placebo week due to this."
671,Make sure to talk to your doctor about it though to make sure you have enough of your prescription if you decide to do so.
672,"When it comes to the condoms and the fingering, youre fine."
673,You had protected sex which means protected from pregnancy and you cant get pregnant from fingering.
674,"If women could, all of us would have kids and abortions in the double digits."
675,Now it also depends with the extra pills what type of pill you are on.
676,Combo pills have a 12 hour window to take them on time and the mini pills has a three hour window (some have a 12 hour but for the most part 3 hour.
677,"Desogestrel is 12 hours)A missed pill for the combo pill is two in a row, for missed pills you take the one you missed along with the one youre supposed to take, if this is what happened then you do not have to skip the placebo week, you are fine.Mini pills its one, and same rules apply however you wear condoms for three days.When it come to diarrhea a lot of the time it is ass blasting, praying to the gods, the toilet is your new friend, food poisoning like diarrhea."
678,"One or two isnt gonna do much however if it is the whole day or lasts multiple days, then your protection may be compromised."
679,If that applies to you when it comes to the diarrhea then skip the placebo week.
680,Not sure for the reason for extra pill.
681,"But for me to feel comfortable with the situation I personally would skip the placebo week, however thats my comfort level when it comes to the situation"

686,Thanks for the response!
687,Im on the combination pill (need to take it in the 12 hour window).
688,The diarrhea...euhmmm just one day and it was mostly in the morning (after those 4 hours).
689,you can use this(To weigh how bad it was.
690,"I think really you have to be on the pill for 7 days, just use condoms in the meantime when it comes to it."
691,Im not sure why the extra pill was used is more of my thing.
692,Im assuming it was a missed pill previously.But use that to determine how to move forward.However you still are protected from pregnancy with the condom
693,The link helped!
694,Had diarrhea in those 24 hours...and indeed I didn't need that extra pill (never miss my birth control pills).
695,I think my anxiety got the best of me with the precum and fingering story.
696,"We are going to use condoms for a couple of days, so that I don't need to worry about this."
697,"Yeah, and precum majority of the time does not contain sperm."
698,The reason why people bring it up is because the pull out method is absolute dogshit to rely upon as someones only method.
699,So if you get a little on your fingers its whatever.
700,"The only issue is if lets say he ejaculates, and doesnt pee after because then sperm can be in the urethra and if someone was having unprotected (meaning no birth control or condoms) sex they could get pregnant from that."
701,And some men leak a little sperm before they shoot their shot.
702,But precum itself is normally a lubricant.
703,"(Delete if not allowed)Could anyone share their positive experiences with the combination pill in terms of helping with endometriosis, PMDD, etc."
704,Im about to start it at a low dose but Im super terrified of the side effects.
705,But I am also excited to not have such painful periods anymore.
706,Just want to hear some good things and hopefully ease my anxiety a little.

724,I have been on Nexaplanon for a little over a year now.
725,Ive had unprotected sex on it and havent gotten pregnant when ive been ejaculated in.
726,But I always have severe anxiety afterwards that I may get pregnant.
727,How do I calm this anxiety?
728,Would it be bad if I took a Plan B while on Nexaplanon to ease my anxiety?
729,"Definitely dont use Plan B, as its a huge dose of hormones."
730,Maybe use a condom or have your partner pull out so you can ease your anxiety.
731,You do not need to take plan b. Nexplanon is about as effective as birth control gets without removing organs.
732,"If you dont feel comfortable with that, use condoms or make him pull out"
733,Nexplanon is the most effective reversible birth control we have.
734,"Definitely don't take Plan B if you have an unexpired Nexplanon, that's so much unnecessary progestin and definitely isn't a healthy way to manage your anxiety."
735,If anxiety continues to interfere with your life you might let your doctor know so you can work on your anxiety.
736,"I have anxiety too so I get it and how hard it is to talk to someone about, but I wish I had talked to my doctor much sooner than I did."
737,It helps to understand that sex while on Nexplanon is protected sex (as long as we're talking about pregnancy and not STIs).
738,"Yes you can add other nonhormonal options like condoms, withdrawal, diaphragms, etc."
739,if it helps you to feel like you're taking every precaution available to you.
740,You most likely have nothing to worry about.
741,"However, if you are this concerned, why not use a secondary barrier method of contraception?"
742,Have you talked to someone about your anxiety?

749,"my friends still dont genuinely know how bad it is and this isnt something i talk about to anyone either, in about a month I will get a doctor again and will bring this up."
750,different anxieties bother different parts of my life.
751,the anxiety of being pregnant and not knowing is probably the one that affects the most.
752,in the moment i never think about it tbh.
753,we were both virgins so im never too stressed about an STD/STI.
754,I have not talked to someone about my anxiety.
755,"I havent had access to a doctor, but I will soon hopefully"
756,Yeah most people don't understand how disruptive it can be and just want to brush it off as nerves or something.
757,"I even downplayed my own for years as just ""my normal"" so I didn't seek help until my mid 30s and my only regret is that I didn't do it sooner."
758,I am glad you have a plan to get some help/guidance in taking your life back from this awful anxiety.
759,I wish you the best!
760,"Yeah that might be something to get checked out, because I feel like even if you were to use condoms along with nexplanon, it wont take long until you think you can get pregnant with that."
761,"And then youre back at square 1, its usually what happens with fears like that, its nothing against you."
762,"Chances of getting pregnant on nexplanon alone though in all honesty, you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning twice and winning the lottery than getting pregnant."
763,And adding condoms to it will also make it effective.
764,"Its a comfort level thing, but watch out a little bit and try to take a step back if youre starting to somehow think you can get pregnant with condoms being added also."
765,"I started this birth control on August 9th, and was having a good time with it until 2 weeks ago."
766,"I started my period, and at first, it was just a normal period, but then it went on longer than 5 days and is now on day 11."
767,"The bleeding wasnt as bad, but just today it has gotten pretty bad."
768,"I thought maybe I cut myself when wiping, but the blood wont go away."
769,Its been on and off for the past few days.
770,There wont be any blood until I check then I start bleeding.
771,I have really painful cramps that sometimes make me hunch in pain a bit.
772,They werent too bad until today.
773,I did some research on the medication and it said after every 21 pills to take a seven day break which I havent done.
774,Has anyone else been on the birth control and has this happened to you?
775,"I called my doctors office and the woman said this is normal for the first three months, and Ive only been on them for a month and a half."
776,She said if it doesnt get better by Monday to call back.
777,Everyday I cry in pain because I just want this to be over with.
778,Maybe the birth control is making me a bit too emotional.
779,I just want to stop bleeding.

800,How do i use plan b?
801,its called the mornng after pill so do i have to wait til then
802,Don't rely on Plan B.
803,It doesn't work if you take it just before or after ovulation.
804,It also loses a lot of its effectiveness if you weigh more than 165 pounds.
805,It's likely to cause irregular bleeding and hormonal side effects.
806,"It's worth it to lower the risk of pregnancy in an emergency, but a man not liking condoms is not an emergency."
807,Someone who wants to have unprotected sex and leave you to deal with the consequences is being irresponsible and inconsiderate.
808,"And who knows with how many people he refused to wear a condom since the last time he was tested.If you really want to have sex with this man without a condom, consider using female condoms yourself."
809,"If you need to take Plan B it should be done as soon as possible, not the morning after."
810,Ella (ulipristal acetate) is more effective but in the US it requires a prescription.
811,"The copper IUD can be inserted up to 5 days after sex as EC, but it's often hard to get an appointment in time."
812,"Frankly, I'd reschedule the appointment or not go at all."
813,"If he doesn't have any STDs, when was his last test?"
814,Was it recent?
815,Has he had sex since that test?
816,"Did that test include HSV (herpes), which most STD test panels do not include?"
817,"If he hasn't shown you the test results himself, and the test wasn't in the last couple of days, how can you rely on his word that he is clean?"
818,"Plan B is only 89 effective at best, and will not work if you are ovulating or already ovulated at the time of taking it, which can only be taken after sex."
819,"Sperm lives for up to 5 days in the uterus  that's why people who follow the fertility awareness method don't have sex for a whole week before ovulation, or use barrier methods."
820,"I'm not trying to sound condescending, but these are questions I wish I asked when I was younger and in your shoes."
821,"Trust me hon, STDs aren't worth it."
822,Neither is pregnancy.
823,Trust me.
824,you take it after your plan a (which would be the condom) fails.
825,it delays your ovulation.
826,"so, with that being said its not advisable for him not to wear a condom (it does not matter if he doesnt have any STIs) especially when you are about to ovulate."
827,Does he want to get you pregnant?
828,Because this is how you get pregnant.Plan B is a huge dose of progesterone.
829,"It works to delay ovulation by a couple days, long enough that the sperm die off, but notably, it doesn't work if you're already really close to ovulation or have already ovulated."
830,"It is notorious for side effects including gastrointestinal upset, mood swings, headaches, nausea, and irregular bleeding."
831,"The irregular bleeding can mean that you skip your period or get it early, or delay it, and this irregularity can last for more than one cycle."
832,I do not recommend using plan B as your primary form of birth control.
833,No hook up is worth the anxiety and side effects.
834,"Plan B is not a form of birth control, its for emergencies, hence the name."
835,"Its Plan B, not Plan A."
836,"It can cause bleeding, cramping, headache, nausea."
837,Theres a good shot itll throw your cycle off for a couple months.

845,Its a very large dose of hormones that will mess up your cycle and give you some side effects that could last for awhile.
846,Plus if youre close to ovulation it wont even be effective which i think some people have already said.
847,"Overall, sounds like a poor idea, but obviously the internet doesnt tell you what to do, its your life and your decisions, so if youre gonna go through with this, at least make sure he pulls out, and plan b is effective up to 72 hours after unprotected sex but ideally as soon as you can after sex so the next morning will be fine."
848,Hsv isn't even traceable in a typical test for it unless it's in its viral shedding phase or there's an active outbreak and possibly when immune system is compromised.
849,Any hook up that refuses condoms is a huge red flag.
850,I mean ew he probably refused with other people he didnt know well too.
851,Def not worth it!
852,Is this for 1 or 2?
853,"I have hsv1 from my mom i assume cause she gets cold sores and if I had to guess she kissed me as a child with one coming on or I drank after her, Ive actually never had a cold sore as an adult (maybe I did as a child and I dont remember) but I do have the virus in my body and it did show up on my panel when they tested me during my pregnancy."
854,"You cannot pass hsv by sharing objects, it's through direct contact such as giving birth or kissing."
855,"For hsv it doesn't matter if it's 1, 2 or 3."
856,Each one only shows up when it is in a phase that is detectable.
857,There's probably some really expensive test where someone can find it but it replicates with your human DNA where it lies dormant.
858,I have hsv1 and I have only tested positive for it once and have had maybe 2 outbreaks after the initial one.
859,"Also, hsv 1 and 2 can be found both on the mouth and the genitals."
860,1 is less aggressive.
861,Being pregnant makes you immunocompromised.
862,Ohh youre right sorry i think my mom told me that (shes not very educated on the disease as is neither much of that genderation which is probably why a ton of kids contracted it when I was growing up) and yes I known both can show up on genitals.
863,I guess I should have clarified that Ive never had an outbreak there either.
864,But obviously if its from my mom kissing me that would definitely not even be a concern.
865,It's very atypical to get outbreaks in multiple places.
866,If it first appeara on the mouth then that's where you will always get it.
867,Also very rare to ever have more than 1 type.
868,I got the Copper IUD same reason as everyone else  non hormonal.
869,"Now, im regretting it."
870,Im on month 4 and my cycle is still not predictable.
871,Month 1 was the best.
872,Period lasted just 10 days.
873,My normal period is 8 days.
874,"Month 2 I forgot to track but it was around 21 ish days Month 3  21 days Month 4  21 days  BUT, I started bleeding aging A WEEK LATER."
875,"In that week, i had a couple days of no spotting, then i started spotting again."
876,"Nbd, i thought, must be ovulation."
877,"Today, I wiped and there was fresh, red blood which has never happened before so soon after my period ended."
878,I feel like its lowkey ruining my sex life.
879,I havent had  sex in over a month because of it.
880,"Whats the point of an IUD if you cant even have sex  Anyways, I dont want to act prematurely because I know it takes times to regulate, but Im thinking of switching over to hormonal."
881,"I originally didnt want to because im already prone to mood swings, and weight gain just as I am without hormones, I dont want to be subjected to it even more with hormones."
882,What should I do?
883,Wait it out or get hormonal?
884,"That sounds awful honestly, I know the biggest side effect is heavy bleeding but that sucks."
885,I will say I have a hormonal IUD(Mirena) and love it.
886,Pills sucked for me emotionally but the IUD hasnt done anything crazy to me.

914,Im also a student with no income so I immediately qualified.

917,"So I tried all the hormonal methods available in the market and all of them worsen my histamine issues and dysautonomia, which I acquired after a COVID infection."
918,Doctors have no idea what the mechanism behind that is and have never seen something like this.
919,So my doctor told me about the Paragard IUD.
920,No contraindications for me because I have light to medium flow and no cramps at all (only mild discomfort but no need for painkillers).
921,All I read are horror stories about the Paragard.
922,Anyone has positive experiences on it?

941,I am on the IUD and I dont get periods but I spot from time to time get a little moody and all the things its like a normal period.
942,Just minus the bleeding but I have such an irrational fear of having a cryptic pregnancy or being pregnant and not knowing it Im pretty sure I spend a lot of the time worrying about it.
943,And then buying dollar store pregnancy tests lol I was just wondering if anybody else has this fear.
944,"I had some random spotting it felt like last week and tender breast and slight weight gain but I also have a crazy work life and eat on the go a lot, pregnancy tests are negative and what not but golly!"

946,Yes!

948,Im not sure what a cryptic pregnancy is but Ive been having pregnancy like symptoms for years on my pill.

965,"I'm currently on day 5 of placebo and have my typical brown discharge that usually indicates a bleed is coming, but all day today I have been tired, headache, and kinda nauseous."
966,"As I was going to the gym, I noticed a very odd sweet taste in my mouth, despite not eating anything in hours."
967,It was like...very sugary?
968,Best way to describe it is the aftertaste of a candy.
969,It's not pleasant at all though.
970,I took a test this morning since I felt fatigue lately and it was negative(17 days after condom sex.

973,I've been under a HUGE amount of stress/workload (full time masters and 95) and have gained about 15lbs and struggling to lose it.

975,I might go get bloodwork done to check sugar levels or something.

994,knowing that I wont take another pack next monthShould we start using condoms on the last active pill?

1025,so i was first prescribed bc in 2021. it was a rough start but when my body adjusted it was pretty good.
1026,but everything changed when my pharmacy stopped carrying it and started giving me the off brand of the same bc.
1027,for some reason my body did not respond well to it.
1028,for months i continued on bc i didnt have a way to access the previous bc (long story).

1037,"my skin was looking much better, my body was too, i felt better, no more PMDD, and light periods."
1038,just everything was so much better and i was so happy.
1039,until my next shipment was late due to my card not going thru.
1040,"bc of this, i was off of it for about two weeks."
1041,"i hoped it wouldnt matter and maybe it could still be okay, but i am now on my second week of the third pack and im miserable again lol."

1043,idk if i can go thru this AGAIN for another month until i readjust.
1044,i cant just stop abruptly bc ik itll mess with my hormones even more.
1045,plus i dont want to bc i was rlly liking this one and i have to be on something (i have endometriosis and PMDD so this helps a lot).

1128,im gonna try to keep this as short as i can lolso when i was 16 i started using a birth control pill called sprintec because my period cycles were very strange.
1129,i would go three months without bleeding and then when i would bleed it would be super heavy.
1130,"fast forward to 5 years later, im still taking the birth control, my period cycles are normal, and i am not sexually active."
1131,i started to notice these weird bumps on my shins.
1132,"after lots of going back and forth with different doctors, my pcp said that it was most likely erythema nodosum."
1133,"after ruling out other factors, she told me to step off my bc pill since my period cycles were normal, and they shouldve evened out about a year after being on the pill (wouldve been nice to know sooner!"
1134,")as soon as i stepped off the birth control, the bumps on my legs went away.fast forward to now i am sexually active and i chose nexplanon."
1135,"when i was on the pill, i never took it everyday at the exact same time, which is what makes it effective, and i figured that would be the case this time too."
1136,"as of now, i am starting to notice another bump on the front of my leg, similar to the ones i had while i was on the bc pill."
1137,ive looked up a lot about erythema nodosum and nexplanon and have found nothing ive only found that most people get it when theyre taking an oral contraceptive.
1138,"i really would rather not step off of nexplanon because 1) its 99.9 effective, and 2) i really would rather not have an iud inserted."
1139,has anyone on nexplanon had this issue?
1140,is this a sign that i should try another birth control method that doesnt involve hormones?

1145,I know this sounds dumb but I have a lot of anxiety about being pregnant.
1146,I started taking birth control (pill Blisovi Fe) about two and a half months ago.
1147,"I noticed I typically would encounter slightly sore breasts, and headaches."
1148,"I also would at times cramp a bit, but nothing like what would occur before bc."
1149,"For context, I had unprotected sex towards the end of August and the first week of September."
1150,"I had what seemed like a cold (runny nose, lots of sneezing and congestion, sore throat, fatigue) last week but it progressively got better."
1151,Im noticing now that Im definitely still fatigued and a bit crampy too.
1152,Ive also been feeling a bit dizzy and weak which I thought maybe was me getting sick again or still fighting off whatever I had but Im not sure.
1153,I dont know if its in my head but I also feel like Ive been peeing more than usual as well.
1154,Ive never missed a day of the pill so far as Ive taken it and take it exactly on time with the exception of maybe 20 minutes one day.
1155,I plan to take a test but I was hoping someone could let me know their thoughts on the likelihood of me being pregnant.
1156,Extremely anxious at the moment and am new to birth control.
1157,The pill is over 99 effective when taken correctly.
1158,You likely got sick and the other symptoms can be side effects from the birth control.
1159,I understand the anxiety.
1160,"You can pair the pill with condoms or pullout if youre anxious, that helped me a lot when I was on it."
1161,"And someones already said it but its over 99 effective, and sounds like youre taking it on time, so you should be fine!"
1162,Dont stress yourself out too much!
1163,If you havent missed a day you are protected.
1164,"It sounds like a cold, not pregnancy symptoms."

1169,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
1170,I get your worry.
1171,You can combine the pill with condoms or withdrawal method for added protection.
1172,It eased my anxiety when I did the same.
1173,"Also, the pill is more than 99 effective if taken correctly."
1174,"So, try not to stress too much  you're likely to be okay!"
1175,"ive been on the pill for 5 years and i still get hormonal symptoms that can be mistaken for pregnancy (breast pain, cramping, etc)."
1176,one time i got so anxious about pregnancy that i actually went through a pseudopregnancy where you get all the symptoms (including frequent urination like u mentioned) and youre just fully convinced despite negative tests telling u otherwise.
1177,it was terrifying.
1178,try not to worry about it too much because you will start tricking your body eventually.
1179,same thing happens when people worry too much about having a heart attack/stroke and then they convince themselves theyre having one bc they feel numbness or chest pain
1180,"Getting a kyleena iud next week, and am wanting to know if anyone has had issues with their partners feeling the strings/having discomfort during sex."
1181,"My friends say that their boyfriends can feel it but that it doesnt cause discomfort, but Im still nervous about it being sharp or uncomfortable for him."
1182,EDIT Paragard as well.
1183,Im not sure which one I want yet.
1184,Have heard kyleena causes weight gain and I absolutely dont need that.
1185,Ask your dr to leave the strings LONG
1186,I have the Mirena and the only time my partner felt them was when I made him to try to find them because I panicked when I couldnt.
1187,"About the weight gain, theres literally no way to know what or if youll have any side effects."
1188,Idk about the Kyleena but with the Mirena I was bloated for a couple months then it came off.
1189,Im getting Kyleena next week as well ) my OB said she has not experienced weight gain with it.
1190,"And my friend who has it has not gained weight either from it.Also, many variations of birth control can cause weight gain especially if its estrogenbased )"
1191,My bf did lol.
1192,One of my strings was crazy short and the other normal length.
1193,They usually didnt cause discomfort but there were a few times in which they did.
1194,It took my bf a few weeks to get used to it.
1195,He said he could feel something there but idk
1196,"For my wife's first IUD, the strings were long."
1197,I could never feel them.
1198,"On her second one, the doc cut them extremely short and they poked me BADLY."
1199,"She had to go back and get them adjusted and now they are a lot better, but they still poke me sometimes."
1200,I'd say it's best to leave them a few inches long
1201,"Sometimes, but after a while the strings get soft."
1202,Depends on position and how long your partner is lol.
1203,"My strings got cut very, very short so I can not even touch them let alone him"
1204,"Mine did, but I would say it depends on how sensitive your partner is, it never got better for him so they cut it super short (dont recommend doing this, had to get mine surgically removed later due to how short the doc cut it)I lost weight on kyleena as well, loved the hormones, just not the cramps/pain that came with the iud for me."
1205,Everyone is diff tho
1206,My boyfriend can feel my strings but only in certain positions when hes deep.
1207,If your partner can feel the strings they can cut them shorter to avoid it.
1208,"In my case, I asked my boyfriend if he wanted me to but he said it was fine due to the circumstances so weve just left him."
1209,I cant feel the strings myself so I rely on him to tell me if he can feel them so I know its still in place  As for the weight gain.
1210,"Ive definitely gained weight, however, I dont do anything to control it."
1211,Im pretty lazy so I dont go to the gym and I dont watch what I eat as I was used to having a high metabolism.
1212,"In my case, Im happy with the weight gain because I used to be 59 at 115lbs whereas Im now at 150lbs and no longer look like a skeleton bc of my metabolism."

1217,i have kyleena and my partner has never been able to feel the strings
1218,Yes
1219,Yes.
1220,My partner could feel them the entire time I had my IUD.
1221,"He strongly disliked the feeling, and said it tickled didnt stop him from going in though so"
1222,I just got mine replaced and my boyfriend cannot feel it despite his size and position we might be in.
1223,I want to say he could feel the last one but I don't remember.
1224,"If he is feeling if, he doesn't realise it."
1225,Could depend on the shape of your vagina as well.
1226,If it needs adjusting you can always go back or cintact planned parenthood for an appointment.
1227,It does take 24 weeks for the string to soften though so he might feel it at first for a while.
1228,I think mine was just positioned and cut well.
1229,I don't remember any cutting but we were talking because I was pretty uncomfortable as I took the uterus medication wrong and it didn't do shit for me
1230,Why?
1231,Didnt know I could haha
1232,Ive had 2 iuds.
1233,The first one the dr cut the strings off so they were just spikes coming out of my cervix.
1234,"Second one I dont think the dr cut them at all, or if she did she left them very long."
1235,These ones just kinda tuck out of the way and cause no issues.
1236,If you wanna stab your dude in the tip of his dick go ahead and have them cut short
1237,"As a dude whose dick has been stabbed by my wife's strings, can confirm it is absolutely terrible lol"
1238,"Haha okay, about how long should I leave them?"
1239,Just dont want to stab my man
1240,I dont think my dr. cut mine at all?
1241,my bf doesnt feel anythingWhen i got my iud in she said they arent supposed to stick out or get caught on my bfs head lol..just lay flat at the top up there
1242,"I think mine are a couple inches, may be even longer."
1243,"Ya during my second insertion there was never a moment where the dr told me she was cutting them, and she was really good about telling me everything that happened, so I assume she didnt."
1244,Hi!

1258,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
1259,As others pointed out your pill has a 12 hour window so you are good.
1260,"If you were on a 3 hour pill it would just mean you need to make sure you take the next day's pill earlier (no later than 27 hours after the one you took early, preferably right at the 24 hour mark)."
1261,So do you think im safe?
1262,My Gyno/the package says its a 3 hour window
1263,Heres a link to the Yaz leaflet.
1264,( The 12 hour window is mentioned on page 7.
1265,Youre within the 12 hour window so its fine!
1266,Had unprotected sex and he came inside me.
1267,I am expecting my period in the next two days.
1268,Should I take plan b??
1269,I heard it doesnt do anything if its around day 26 on your cycle.
1270,It doesnt do anything if youve already ovulated.
1271,A test is definitive 21 days after sex
1272,Unless you confirm ovulation through temping you cannot know if your period is coming in two days.
1273,You need plan b if you dont want to get pregnant.
1274,Use condoms or talk to your doctor about birth control if you dont want to get pregnant.
1275,You should take Plan B.
1276,Calendar based tracking is not reliable.
1277,You have no way to know if your period will actually come when expected or if youre having an irregular cycle.
1278,Use condoms going forward.
1279,I think you can pass on the plan b this time
1280,"Better safe then sorry, taking plan b doesnt hurt if youve already ovulated and are out of your fertile window but not taking it will hurt if you happen to be irregular and get pregnant."
1281,"Take plan B, its not gonna poison you or anything if you dont need it, and as others have said make sure youre using at least one, preferably 2 methods of birth control (ex."

1290,so i got the mirena iud after much much research and asking a lot of questions at planned parenthood today.
1291,i was terrified of the procedure but all in all it went ok i think.
1292,"the most painful part was measuring and insertion but i am doing ok. for the people who have gotten this iud, when does the crampy feeling end?"
1293,my cramps scale from about a 5 to a 10. i just want to be prepared if this crampy feeling is consistent for a bit.
1294,Honestly Ive had mine (kyleena) from around mid June and the cramps have just started to subside.
1295,Like I get them ever so often but for the most part I had them almost everyday for the first 2 months.
1296,Ive also had like a mini period (spotting?)
1297,or a day or 2 with SUPER light spotting ever since I got it in and havent been able to track my actual period.
1298,Best thing for the crams tho is to take sum ibuprofen or Tylenol!

1364,Hi all I'm two days into my new back of BC and I noticed that I've started bleeding today.
1365,Typically I can go 23 months skipping the placebo until the bleeding starts and it will not stop until I let myself have an actual period.
1366,The only issue is I'm flying out across the country to see my boyfriend in 26 days.
1367,I was breakthrough bleeding the last time I saw him and I really don't want that to be the case this time.
1368,I want to start my placebo week but I've already taken the first 2 pills in my new pack of Nikki and it's the only pack I have access to at the moment.Can I just stop and take the placebo pills and resume after on day 3 of the active?

1373,Well if I were you I'd just take the rest of this weeks pills and then take the whole week of placebo pills to bleed everything out then resume the pills.
1374,"If I'm understanding the timeline correctly you should still have a full week after your placebo pills to have the hormones back in your system completely.Or you can do what you said at the end and take 7 sugar pills now then resume, the only reason I would do it the first way is so my pack isnt missing pills in random places and it would confuse me a little yk."
1375,"So I got my first depo shot a month ago and have had daily spotting, cramps, low SD, etc."

1389,Hey!
1390,I am sorry you are feeling this way.
1391,I was on the repo shot for a year and exhibited all these side affects.
1392,"In fact it got the point where I ended up in tears at my drs office cause I was feeling depressed, had weight issues and stomach ulcers."
1393,Thankfully they pulled me off of it but I still exhibit some side affects years later.
1394,If there is something else that works better for you I implore you to go with that.
1395,This is one of the BC methods I wish had a 100 more warnings.
1396,"If you are feeling it now, it will not go away."
1397,What works for some doesnt work for everyone listen to your body!
1398,Good luck.
1399,Hi!!
1400,I had all of these side effects as well and can say that they never stopped.
1401,Not hopeful (.
1402,"Ah, well I was hoping it'd fade, but I guess I'll have to wait for the drug to make its way out of my system."
1403,"I had regular period on the pill, never had pain and always got it on time."
1404,"I started taking birth control at 16 (I'm now 23), and I stopped for 6 months when I was 19 ( I didn't had my period too) so I went to a doctor and he told me that I needed to be on the birth control and didn't explained why."
1405,"So I was on birth control since my 19 till now, 23, and I stopped the birth control on June and I haven't had my period since then."
1406,Is it normal?
1407,Should I be worried?
1408,It can take up to a year for your cycle to regulate after birth control.
1409,If youre worried you can always go to the doctor and ask about it.
1410,Irregular periods are a common side effect of things like PCOS but I would give it longer before being concerned about that.

1415,Your body will take time to adjust.
1416,When I stopped the pill I didn't have a period again for almost a year
1417,this happened to me once when I was 19.
1418,I was super regular but my period stopped like for 4 months and I was not sexually active at the time.
1419,My Dr. gave me provera which induces period and thats all it took for me to get back on track with my period.
1420,thank you!!!
1421,I will wait a lil bit longer
1422,thank you!!!
1423,im just afraid that I have consequences in my health for not having it
1424,thank you!!
1425,maybe I will go to the doctor and talk about that
1426,Don't worry about that.
1427,The doctor should have explained why they thought you should be on it in the first place.
1428,Obviously the benefit of it is extremely low risk of pregnancy so as long as you have other prevention methods you should be good.
1429,I just need reassurance from other people who have taken the pill.
1430,I feel like a completely different person on the pill.
1431,Im trying my tenth brand in almost as many years and theyve all been the same.
1432,"I dont want to try something else, I dont want a different brand  I just cannot do it."
1433,"I cant.I feel like, well, it couldnt POSSIBLY just be the pill making me feel this way, I MUST be crazy, too."
1434,"But when I went off the pill for the first time when I was 2021, it felt so completely different."
1435,It felt like the world was in colour again.
1436,"Im irritable, Im easily triggered, its like my mental health has taken 10 steps back, I think Im just plain annoying  I nitpick which I would never otherwise do, etc etc."
1437,I feel so flat and disconnected and awful.
1438,"I just need reassurance that Im not crazy, that I can trust myself that this IS the pill (especially since I KNOW I feel/am so different off of it)."
1439,Has anyone else had experiences like this?
1440,"( PS Im on the placebo week of my last box, and then thats it for me.Edit I went to the concert of one of my longtime favourite musicians with my partner last night and I felt nothing."
1441,"There were several times throughout the night where I just kept thinking to myself wow, I am not feeling anything at all right now."
1442,No highs.
1443,No excitement.
1444,"I could feign it because it WAS good and it WAS exciting, but I didnt FEEL any of that."
1445,I hate this.
1446,It started 1.52 months into this pill.
1447,I've been taking Alysena since Jul 2022.
1448,"The first three months were crazy for me, I felt my mental health plummet (There were other factors there, but the pill just added to it with all the hormones), the mood swings were just crazy."
1449,I have the same problem with every BCP hurting my mental health and making me foggy.
1450,I get so jealous because it seems like tons of people just take the pill and go about their day.
1451,I dont know why I cant be like that.
1452,Im on my absolute last try of a new pill right now.
1453,"I feel way better and different off it, but I have bad period flu and period pain/bleeding so Im really trying to find one I can tolerate because it helps a ton with that."
1454,I feel you and youre not crazy!

1459,"So basically I'm just curious, I've been on birth control since December 2020 (I just turned 17) till this August (I'm 19 now)."
1460,"I stopped because I wanted to give my body a rest from it because imo I started with it very young... My gynaecologist told me that I'm perfectly healthy and that I don't have to stop but I still wanted although I didn't have any bad symptoms because of it but yeah... however its almost two months that I'm off birth control and the biggest thing that I noticed is change in my energy level, it increases so much that I don't understand how was I functioning before."
1461,Every morning when I wake up I feel so rested and full of energy and it lasts whole day.
1462,So I just wanted to ask if some of you had the same experience with it?
1463,?
1464,"Last pill fucked me up, had to sleep 10 hours or more to be able to function properly and no one knew why."
1465,Concentration problems as well thanks to my extreme fatigue.
1466,Switched to the implant and now I have energy again.
1467,I was on the pill from 19 to 31 and after I got off the pill my energy level increased.
1468,My partner even noticed that I wanted to do more active things in my freetime.
1469,"Im currently on microgynon 30 (combined pill) and I feel incredibly fatigued, I really never feel well rested."
1470,Has anyone experienced this and then found a pill that helped/didnt have this side effect?
1471,"Not the same BC but I'm almost 4 weeks post the 12 weeks depo provera ""expiry"" and the last 4 weeks I've been tired as hell."
1472,"But depo takes the longest to get out of your system (which I wasnt informed about by the nurse, so angry..) so im hoping it'll resolve soon."
1473,Bc drains my energy.
1474,Ive tried 4 different kinds and they all wipe me out
1475,I think birth control depletes you of b6/b12 vitamins.
1476,"When I first started taking bc I was sad, moody, and tired all the time and taking b6/b12 supplement helped with that."
1477,OCPs make me extremely sluggish .
1478,Feels like my muscles dont work anymore.
1479,Ive come off several due to this.
1480,Both the pills I tried (lo loestran and Junel FE) as well as the Kyleena IUD significantly decreased my energy levels.
1481,"I would get 8 hours of sleep and still wake up exhausted, crash in the afternoon, etc."
1482,I had my IUD removed a week ago and in the last couple days Ive noticed my energy levels are so high.
1483,"Im not needing a full 8 hours, waking up is so much easier, and no afternoon crashes."
1484,"Everyones body is different, and everyone has a different threshold for what they want to live with."
1485,So I definitely hear and see you!
1486,"This week has been crazy, seeing how much better I feel even after just a week."
1487,Im glad youre feeling better )
1488,Ive felt way more energetic on bc than off

1493,Omg it made me so fatigued I had to take naps 24/7
1494,The first kind of BC I take makes me so emotional that I cry so fucking much.
1495,"Got off it and felt like wtf just happened, like Im finally myself again."
1496,Changed it to a different type and got no side effects at all.
1497,Ive honestly noticed that Im on the pill now and my energy is the lowest its ever been.
1498,"Im switching to Kyleena next week so I hope that helps the energy levels go up again.Edit Im usually a morning person and ever since getting on the pill, its been a huge struggle to not feel sluggish in the morning and throughout the day, even after enough sleep."
1499,"I guess it didnt affect energy levels per se, but being on the pill for about around 4 years gave me horrible insomnia."
1500,It started off not being too bad.
1501,I would have maybe 1 or 2 nights a month where I wouldnt sleep at all.
1502,"It got progressively worse over time until it became more of a weekly occurrence, then it was more than once a week."
1503,The final straw was when I went 3 consecutive days with little to no sleep.
1504,I think I maybe got 12 hours of sleep over that 3 day period?
1505,It was an absolutely awful experience and not something I would wish upon anyone.
1506,I had to stop taking the pill because it was really taking a toll on my mental health and personal life.
1507,Ive been off the pill for a few weeks now and Ive been sleeping so much better and I havent had any sleepless nights since I stopped taking it.
1508,Got my Kyleena iud out about a month ago and feel like i have tons of energy compared to my past 10 years of hormonal birth control
1509,Thats so good to hear because Im struggling with energy on the pill now and switching to the IUD next week.
1510,Its so hard for me to get up in the mornings and Ive always been a morning person.
1511,I'm on the same pill and I've had chronic fatigue since I started it almost two years ago.
1512,I don't know what to change to either (
1513,I hope it works!
1514,"I am personally apparently very sensitive to estrogen in general, but everyone is different."
1515,A lower hormone method can definitely help for some people!
1516,Its really difficult I feel for you!
1517,Do you have any other side effects?
1518,"Mine are mostly chronic fatigue, moodiness(from being constantly fatigued), water retention and bloating and I did have migraines/headaches but not really anymore.What I did find out through Reddit is that microgynon has higher progesterone (I thought it was oestrogen but I had no clue) and the progesterone thats high in Microgynon is androgenic so if you naturally have higher androgen it can worsen the symptoms that come with high androgen, PCOS runs in my family and this means you produce more androgens so Im thinking that might be the biggest factor for my next pill is finding one that isnt progesterone dominant, especially with androgenic progesterone."
1519,"(I found all this out on Reddit, still need to speak to a doctor about what it means and what my options are lol).Its amazing what they dont tell you about the birth control they give you as medical professionals so here we are on Reddit looking for answers!"
1520,I hope the progesterone in the Kyleena will be better for my body since Im currently on an estrogen based bc pill.
1521,Thank you )
1522,I believe the progesterone in microgynon is levonorgestrel so this might be what to look out for in your next pill too!
1523,"Oh man, I suspected I had PCOS for years  that would in fact make sense!!"
1524,"Fatigue is really the only side effect I experience, which sucks because I palmed it off as ""I didn't get loads of side effects, so it's fine,"" but it is starting to wear me down."
1525,It is indeed!
1526,Thank you so much for all the information.
1527,It's super interesting!
1528,I got my IUD (Mirena) removed 2 weeks ago.
1529,"2 days after removal, I got what seemed to be a normal period that lasted a week."
1530,"I went through mood swings, feeling particularly down."
1531,"Two days ago, I started feeling heart palpitationsas if my heart skips a beat."
1532,"It doesnt happen with the same frequency everyday, but obviously anxiety about it makes it worse."
1533,Has anyone else felt this while going through their Mirena crash?

1539,I had so much anxiety about my birth control pills in hot temperatures and not Im having anxiety about them being in cooler temperatures now that the change of seasons is here.
1540,I live in PA and it is starting to be fall.
1541,Im not worried about when I keep my pill at my house cause everything is pretty well temperature controlled but at my boyfriends house his house isnt well insulated or temperature controlled.
1542,When it gets to winter temps it is FREEZING in his house and Im not exaggerating when I say that.
1543,Im scared my birth control is gonna get compromised cause I can bet it gets to around 30 degrees in that house in the winter.
1544,Also it is going to be cooler this weekend and night temperature will reach about 55 degrees.

1550,"If you look on the package insert that comes with your birth control, it should give you a range of temperatures!"
1551,I already know the range of temperatures its between 6977 degrees.
1552,Im asking what if my pill is in a place that is outside that range.
1553,I cant really change the temp in my bfs apartment to make it warmer when its cold.
1554,Without knowing which pill youre on it would be hard to say.
1555,Usually on the package insert theres excursion temperatures which will tell you how long it can be out of rhe 6977 range and still be good.
1556,I would either call the manufacturer to ask (in the pharmacy thats what we do with (usually fridge) meds that were stored improperly for whatever reason) or ask the pharmacist
1557,Im on Junel Fe 1/20
1558,I (24f) recently got off the pill about 3 months ago and have noticed my sex drive has gone WAY up.
1559,To the point where Im thinking about sex a few times a day.
1560,I just got out of a long term relationship and am not sexual active at the moment which could have something to do with it.
1561,Has anyone else experienced this when getting off the pill?
1562,Getting horny out of nowhere all the time lol?
1563,I had to do a big detox after exhibiting extreme side affects from my birth control.
1564,Lets just say me and my partner were much happier in the bed!
1565,Its totally normal.
1566,Your hormones are being given the opportunity to work as they should without suppression!
1567,Well think about it pills pump you full of hormones to trick your body into thinking youre pregnant to stop ovulating.
1568,It basically supresses your sexuality to an extent

1579,The other few comments seem to think similarly.
1580,I dont think this is a controversial take
1581,"So I have been taking Junel Fe 1/20 for nearly a hear now and Id like to think Ive been relatively consistent with taking my doses at the same time every day, but there has been days where I missed or taken a pill late, so I have a couple of questionsFirst, what is considered a missed pill?"
1582,A lot of confusion Ive been getting when searching this up is that it is unclear when a pill is considered missed.
1583,Some articles would say a missed pill is 24 hours since the last pill taken and others would say 24 hours from the normal time you take your pill.
1584,"Which is true?For context, today is Thursday and the last pill I had taken was on Tuesday at around 56pm."
1585,I had not taken the Wednesday pill until today at 1230pm.
1586,"In my pamphlet, it says that if you miss one active pill to just take it as soon as remembered and continue taking the rest of the pack accordingly."

1602,Hello I have a long history with birth control.
1603,I started as a teen due to cramping  getting so sick (like throwing up in pain and not being able to keep food down for the first two days of my period).
1604,I started on pills and as time went on it started to really also make me nauseous (also as I became sexually active teen I just wanted reassurance that I was using the safest forms for myself).
1605,I switched to the nexplanon  it was the best decision of my life.
1606,No problems  some weight gain but it eventually evened out within a year (around 15lbs heavier than normal but fine with me).
1607,The second insertion of nexplanon was fine until the last year  I started spotting/bleeding and getting the worst mood swings Ive ever gotten.
1608,My doctor and I opted to take it out.
1609,I then went for a kyleena iud.
1610,The insertion has been hell  have been cramping EVERYDAY and bleeding (not spotting but like actual flow) EVERYDAY for the past 45 days.. also my acne has gotten even worse.
1611,I also cramp so much when I work out to the point where I just have to walk or sit down.
1612,Also I have very little libido  when I am sexually active sex doesnt feel good/feeling numb or sometimes pain?
1613,"I know it takes time for bodies to adjust  everyone is different, but does anyone have words of advice?Is it too soon to tell?"
1614,Do I get the iud removed?
1615,Do you think the nexplanon is a viable option to go back to?
1616,Does my body need a break from birth control?
1617,Should I finish the year off with the pills if I get my iud removed and then try nexplanon again?
1618,"Nexplanon side effects can change toward the end of its lifespan due to the hormones becoming lower (still effective tho).If you choose to stick this out further, you're far more patient than me lmao."
1619,45 days of bullshit is a longass time.

1654,The only thing you need to worry about is pregnancy  keep it in for at least 7 days after the last time you had unprotected sex.

1656,My husband and I had unprotected sex on 9/13 in the middle of the night.
1657,We are trying to conceive baby 2 but remembered I can not be pregnant on my medication before weaning off.
1658,I took a plan b a few hours later in the early morning.
1659,"Yesterday on 9/20(7 days later) I started cramping and spotting, and today 9/21 (8 days later) I have what seems like  my full blown period?"
1660,I am 2 days from ovulation according to my period tracker and I am not due for my period for another 2.5 weeks.
1661,Is this normal?
1662,Ive seen information that spotting and irregular bleeding can be a side effect of the pill.
1663,But I have never had this experience after taking it.

1675,Ive heard about withdrawal bleeding.
1676,"So the bleed you had might have not been your period, but rather caused by the drop in hormones now that the pill is out of your body."
1677,Your uterus is clearing itself out due to the pill.
1678,Im going through the same thing because my actual period is due in 9 days
1679,Yes I know.
1680,I wasnt expecting it on time I was more so expecting it late if anything from previous experiences.
1681,I just felt as if the bleeding was particularly heavy for things Ive read about irregular bleeding being more like spotting.

1687,I was accidentally taking my bc pills on the week of my sugar pills (its a long story) instead of taking that break like my pack allows.
1688,Is this okay?
1689,I didn't get my period like I usually do is this because I didn't take that break?I stopped for a few days like from Sunday to Wednesday because I thought I was on my sugar pills week but turns out I was supposed to already be starting a new pack.
1690,To fix this I decided to just continue on my new pack and forget that break I was supposed to take.
1691,Did I make the right choice?
1692,Should I be worried if my period doesn't come at all?
1693,Please let me know!

1698,Skipping the placebo week is fine!
1699,"You probably wont bleed until your next placebo week, thats normal."
1700,The placebo week is not medically necessary.
1701,It only exists because it can help reduce breakthrough bleeding (which is bleeding while taking active pills) and some people just prefer bleeding every month.
1702,"Skipping, shortening, or delaying a pill break is completely fine!"
1703,"Just dont make it longer or start it too soon  youre only protected during the break if you take active pills for at least 21 consecutive days before starting the break, and youre only protected during an up to 7 day break."
1704,"Because combination birth control works by stopping ovulation, you dont have a natural cycle or a true period while on combo birth control."
1705,"Instead, you get a withdrawal bleed caused by the drop in hormones during the break/ placebos."
1706,"So, your period likely wont come until you start your next placebo week."
1707,"That said, skipping a withdrawal bleed can increase the chances of breakthrough bleeding, so dont be alarmed if you have irregular bleeding while taking active pills this month."
1708,I just started my second month of Yaz mainly for my acne and so far it's only made me super depressed and tired.
1709,I've been taking Prozac for maybe a year now and it was working good but now it's not helping at all.
1710,Did anyone else experience depression on Yaz and did it get better?
1711,I figured I should give it a couple months to see if it regulates itself but I can hardly get out of bed.

1719,"disclaimer that before i make a decision, i am going to speak to my gyne about it."
1720,im just curious to hear about different experiences.
1721,so ive been on yaz for about 8 months now and side effectwise its been pretty great EXCEPT that i started having pain during penetration thats from dryness.
1722,"this normally is the worst after dry spells, but if im active then over time it does go away."
1723,its almost as if my vagina just needs to get used to things again.
1724,lube also does help a lot.
1725,"however, since im a paranoid person, i started thinking long term."

1733,Im skipping periods right now and I havent had one since June.
1734,"Well recently, I have taken a pill late and suddenly Im having cramping and light spotting."
1735,I have been told I may have pcos by my gyno (she suspects that I do) and Im not sure if this could be causing the spotting?
1736,Ive taken pills late and missed pills but never had spotting like this?
1737,Im back on track now too so Im confused as to why this is happening.
1738,Can anyone help?

1748,It's my second IUD.
1749,I love it!
1750,Your OB said she will give you anesthetic.
1751,I'm assuming it is something that will numb or soften the cervix.
1752,That will help.
1753,Also take some Ibuprofen before going in to your appointment.

1774,Im currently seeing a cardiologist who stated its possible due to the estrogen.
1775,My concern was the provider who ordered the Nuvaring stated its localized and shouldnt affect the rest of my body.
1776,"But the Mirena is same localized and worry how it can affect me.Extra info current form of bc use is FAM, female/male condoms, cayaspermicide, and pullout method."

1794,"I currently have nexplanon and this stupid thing has caused nothing but issues, including a 30 pound weight gain."
1795,"I dont trust the pills in the slightest, so Im going with the IUD."
1796,"I had it once before, but it was inserted while I was asleep for surgery so I never experienced it going in."
1797,"Having it taken out hurt, but nothing like what I hear some people describe.I am TERRIFIED to get it put in while Im awake."
1798,Like Im talking having panic attacks just by thinking about it.
1799,Ive heard from some sources that getting it inserted while on your period makes it a bit easier to handle.
1800,Is that true?
1801,Experiences from other people?
1802,Im just so freakin scared of this thing but its the only method I trust.
1803,I had mine inserted on my period(my doctor only inserts during periods) she also prescribed a cervical softening medication and gave me a cervical block.
1804,It still hurt and gave me a vasovagal response that made me nearly pass out.
1805,I would insist on those things to help as well as having someone you trust with you to talk you through it.
1806,IUD insertion was one of the worst pains of my life.
1807,"But it was also short lived, a few minutes."
1808,I would 100 do it again.
1809,The cramping afterward was like a bad period and last a few daysa week.
1810,"Ibuprofen helped.Ive also been told being on your period makes it easier and had both of mine inserted then, but still literally screamed the whole time."
1811,The screaming actually made me feel better lol If youre extremely anxious you can ask for Ativan or Xanax ahead of the procedure as long as you have someone to drive you.Edited to addMy second insertion I had a local anesthetic injected into my cervix.
1812,That hurt like a fucking bitch and idk if that was better or worse but the insertion wasnt painful after that one.
1813,"Again, no idea if the shot hurt more than the insertion would have."
1814,It was not fun.
1815,"More people talk about their bad experiences than their good, since a bad experience is a story and a good/neutral experience is boring.Anyway, it hurt and cramped pretty bad, like an especially bad period."
1816,"But then I had ice cream and after the first week of intermittent cramps, zero problems for over 10 years"
1817,"Hi I got my copper iud in 9 days ago, close to ovulation, and it was a much better experience than the horror stories all over the internet."
1818,I think most people dont post their positive stories because they just arent as interesting or they dont really need to get the experience off their chest.I got mine the same day I decided I needed one for safety since plan b doesnt work after ovulation occurs.
1819,I took 400 mg of advil an hour before and the doctor (sweetest lady) gave me another 400 mg and a hot pack for my belly.
1820,"It basically happens in 3 steps, and the whole process took less than 5 minutes."
1821,Id say the procedure for me really wasnt painful!!
1822,Mostly uncomfortable and the sore feeling rather than pain feeling.
1823,It really did just feel like bad period cramps.
1824,The worst part was the very end after you have everything but the iud in you.
1825,You sort of just lay there for a moment waiting for the doctor to grab the iud.
1826,"Placing it in felt like a quick pinch, but my intense anxiety definitely amplified the sensations."
1827,"The entire time I was focused on distracting myself by counting to 100 out loud, deep breathing, and feeling the hot pack on my belly.To be honest the hot pack (which burnt me a bit since it wasnt wrapped) hurt more than the insertion!"
1828,The worst part of the experience was my anxiety and how quickly she put the speculum in.
1829,After the whole thing was done I got to just lay done for 15 minutes until I was comfortable to get dressed.After the procedure I felt good enough to drive an hour home and proceeded to pamper myself and move very carefully haha

1840,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
1841,Copper poisoning doesn't happen.
1842,The IUD is essentially a little bit of copper stuck to a t shape plastic body.
1843,Pain of insertion can be avoided by asking for local anesthetic.
1844,I had this and yes it hurt a little because of the speculum but nothing traumatizing.
1845,Cramps after and some spotting to be expected.
1846,"It can perforate your uterus, yes but this is incredibly rare."
1847,Otherwise they can pull it out whenever just by pulling the string that's hang from your cervix.I love my copper IUD expect from the periods it gives me.
1848,"The stories you hear online are usually the worst of the worst experiences, since those are the most interesting."
1849,Id avoid reading too many of those as itll just make your anxiety worse..Mine felt like bad period cramps but really didnt hurt much worse than that!
1850,Just make sure to take 800mg of advil an hour before the procedure and ask for a hot pack or whatever your doctor offers ) Learn ways to distract yourself and manage the stress.
1851,One thing I wish I had was a stressball to squeeze.
1852,Instead I counted to 100 through the whole thing.
1853,It was all over in 5 minutes for me and I got to lay down and relax for a while after.
1854,"It will feel sore, and at the end there is a quick pinch when the iud is placed, and then its over."
1855,A lot of people recommend getting it in during your period too!
1856,Should make the whole thing easier it sounds like
1857,Hi queens!
1858,So i just started Sprintec birth control again.
1859,"I was on it April 2018 to February 2023, and had no major problems whatsoever and also no side effects during the adjustment period other than nausea."
1860,"In August of this year, i started getting extremely unbearable cramps and periods for the first time ever since stopping my pills 7 month prior."
1861,"It was bad enough that i decided to get on birth control again, plus i had met someone and am now sexually active again which is another reason why i need it."
1862,Its been about a week and a half since starting it and i felt fine with a tinge of nausea up until 4 days ago and then it was like a switch flipped.
1863,"I just stopped feeling emotion  sounds dramatic but thats how it feels, like im trying to get happy or excited or just feel something and i literally cant."
1864,Nothing brings me joy lol and that is absolutely not like me at all.
1865,It was the most dramatic change i have ever felt in my life and its a little scary im not gonna lie.
1866,Can you have different side effects from the same birth control the second time around??
1867,"It just seems so unlikely if you tolerated it well for a considerable amount of time, like i did.The only other two factors im considering right now are, 1. i took a plan b about 4 days into my pills due to not feeling protected and having unprotected sex and 2. i just went gluten free a week ago due to being diagnosed with celiac and wondering if im in a detox phase thats causing the depressive symptoms.I have had no prior personal or family history of depression."
1868,I am literally the least depressed person i have ever met in my life  just threw me for a loop a little bit.
1869,Im seeing my GI doctor on Tuesday so im going to discuss all of this with him but in the meantime any input is appreciated )

1930,I started taking an oestrogen pill 3 years ago.
1931,"Gained weight, mood swings, headaches, tummy aches etc.Always thought about not taking it anymore but since I'm quite sexually active and absolutely HATE the period...The only 2 positive effects are literally not having to worry so much about getting pregnant (I don't want children, ever) and only having my period every 23 months."
1932,"Everything else, all other side effects are fucking with my mental and physical health."
1933,Not as bad that I would need to stop taking it because of medical reasons.
1934,"But the weight gain is affecting me heavily mentally even though I ""only"" gained 15lbs."
1935,I'm struggling with an eating disorder and can't stop hating my body and myself.Should I stop taking it?
1936,Can I start it again if stopping doesn't change anything?
1937,Is that safe?I hate being a woman.
1938,"Yep, you can take a break from the pill for a few months and then start it again."
1939,"It's safe to do, but you're just not supposed to go on and off the pill all the time."
1940,Going on and off it increases your risk of blood clots.
1941,"To go off the pill, start using condoms 5 days before you stop.There are other options to help with your periods, ask your doctor!"
1942,For example the hormonal IUD or the depo shot can be used to lighten/stop periods (depends on the person).
1943,"Yes, you can start and stop it again if you find that doesnt help."
1944,"You could also try a different form of bc, maybe with a different progestin, and see if that helps."
1945,Or a progestin only form.
1946,"But, speaking from experience, no amount of weight loss will make you okay with yourself if you have an ED."
1947,"And if you meant I hate being a woman in a gender dysphoria way, that probably wont magically go away either."
1948,Have you considered the IUD instead?
1949,You should research  talk to your doc about it!
1950,Sometimes peoples periods stop ( mine still comes but super light bleeding.)
1951,Im no doctor but I do work in the OR with GYNs.

1967,No.
1968,"Unless she is tracking using ovulation tests and confirming with temps, apps are not at all reliable."
1969,"No, the calendar method is not effective but learning and using an actual method can be when done right."

1976,I just got out of seeing my new gynecologist after my old one retired.
1977,Originally my appointment was supposed to be about upping my spironolactone dosage.
1978,"She basically refused and instead pushed this new BC called Nexstellis on me, insisting that I wouldnt even need spironolactone because its so amazing.I tried explaining how long its taken me to find a BC that works for me and she was very dismissive of my concerns."
1979,"It was very frustrating  I guess this is more of a rant post lol.My question is, has anyone else experienced this brand being pushed on them?"
1980,It sounds like just a gyno being bad and dismissive which unfortunately isnt uncommon.
1981,I would try to see someone else next time if you can
1982,You can see what medical brands give your doctors pay outs on this website.
1983,I recently lost my really good insurance.. so I had to pay out of pocket this month because there is no generic.
1984,I was willing because nextellis is so good.
1985,I tried every single low dose bc available and this is the only one that 1) keeps the pain at bay 2) doesnt leave me emotionally wrecked and 3) no pregnancy scares yet 4) my acne has toned down no random hot flashes.
1986,Only downside has been my liver enzymes going up but that can be a couple of things.
1987,I highly recommend.
1988,"I believe Nextellis is relatively new and I find doctors will push newer brands onto people when they first come out, that's not to say it isn't a good pill."
1989,I was written a script for Lolo back in 2018 when it first came out because it was the new pill that doctors were encouraged to prescribe and that has been the only pill to work beautifully for me.
1990,I tried nextellis for 3 months and it ruined my skin and gave me painful periods.
1991,Would not recommend.
1992,It was always out of stock at my pharmacy too.
1993,I used to be on it but only because I found out about it through a Facebook birth control group.
1994,"The doctor is kind of right about being an amazing birth control  as it's the 1st one to have plant based Estrogen, Estretrol.The Estrogen on this pill is safer than Estradiol on all other pills, it doesn't affect diabetics, cholesterol and can't remember what else."
1995,Only reason I stopped using because my body doesn't like me taking any pill a few minutes late or ill cramp or spot and with my new work schedule it was hard.
1996,Which birthcontrol pill u on atm?
1997,My OB currently has me on nextstellis and the only thing I have experienced is lighter periods and maybe more acne.
1998,It isnt covered by my insurance so my OB is super cool and just gives me more nextstellis every time I see her  and this is coming from someone who has had terrible luck on birth control with mood swings etc

2003,"I dont know your doctor, but my job in medication prior authorization has highlighted how insurance companies get kickbacks for preferring and approving one medication over another."
2004,"First of all find a new doctor youre comfortable with, but also be aware that doctors are often thwarted by what insurance companies prefer."
2005,"Yeah, thats my plan."
2006,"Was just such a bummer, I was definitely spoiled with my old gyno lol."
2007,Id tell her I wanted a certain birth control or dosage of spironolactone and shed write the scrip.
2008,This needs more upvotes holyshit
2009,"Wow, OK!"
2010,Good to know.
2011,It was honestly my gynos behavior rather than the brand itself that rubbed me the wrong way.
2012,"nexstellis is hardly low dose though, it's 14mg of estrogen, that's so much"
2013,I would try only if you want to.
2014,Your docs dismissive attitude towards you is common and rude.
2015,Medical Gaslighting is so real.
2016,"I'd personally call the office and tell them about my experience as well as leave a Google review with docs name so others can avoid a similar situation, AND THEN switch doctors tbh.. You don't have to do anything or take anything your doc insists on despite your not wanting change."
2017,Pushing products onto people who don't want change is just bad manners
2018,"It is low dose, is under 30mg and it's Estretrol,  not Estradiol too"
2019,under 30 micrograms is considered a low dose.
2020,14 milligrams is huge.
2021,(a microgram is 0.001 milligrams).
2022,it might be because of the different chemistry of estretol though.
2023,would still really put me off
2024,Oh thats true didn't even notice lol but yeah Estretrol is not as potent
2025,Hi I have been on yaz and I recently switched to the generic version.
2026,I started getting pain around my inner thigh and legs and started to get acne again.
2027,Will I have to wait a few months for my body to adjust?
2028,Or is it just better to switch back to brand.
2029,Generic is alot cheaper but I don't want to have acne.

2045,"i wanted to share my personal experience with Mirena, just because!"
2046,"i had it inserted around 2 years ago, maybe a lil less."
2047,"the insertion experience was great for me, or as well as it could've gone."
2048,"they gave me a valium to calm my nerves when i arrived,  then i went to the table."
2049,"you all probably know the procedure or can do your own research, but i had no problems with it."
2050,"very minimal pain, i gripped the table tightly but didn't feel the need to cry at all."
2051,"it was over in around 10 minutes, with lasting cramps maybe an hour or two later."
2052,i'm pretty sure i just took an ibuprofen  my mom drove me home to take a nap.
2053,no lasting pain afterwards!
2054,i had a bit of spotting for around 45 months afterwards but nothing that required excessive products besides the occasional panty liner.
2055,"after that time had passed, basically nothing."
2056,it gradually slowed down the whole time.
2057,now the absolute best part of this for me was that it stopped my period completely!
2058,"no period symptoms at all, which was such a relief to me because i used to have godawful PMS that had me contemplating life pretty much every month."
2059,i haven't had a period since i had it put in.
2060,"i read this happens to 1/5 women, so i was the lucky 20.   nowadays life is great in these regards."
2061,"no period, no spotting, no cramps, PMS, anything of the sort."
2062,"i've had sex with my ex on it with no condom as well, no complaints there ."
2063,"Mirena is around the same effectiveness, perhaps a bit more, as a plan B pill in terms of preventing pregnancy."
2064,so no need to take onei've read it's actually discouraged.
2065,"i did pregnancy tests around 1x per month when i was sexually active, just in case."
2066,overall my results from Mirena have been exceptional!
2067,i can't guarantee everyone will get as lucky as i did but i felt like posting here to provide a positive experience for someone who is contemplating getting on it.
2068,i recommend it to all my friends who inquire about birth control.
2069,"i've found that most girls are simply just scared of the insertion pain, which for me was truly nothing compared to the outcome i got."
2070,"it does depend on your pain tolerance  personal anatomy, but i'd really suggest it if you feel an IUD would be the best option for you."
2071,"lmk if you have any questions, or make a quick Google search."

2079,My biggest fear is the weight gain.
2080,"I struggle with an eating disorder and am trying to recover, but I dont want to relapse from rapid weight gain."
2081,"I was recommended the IUD in the first place because I have tried several different birth control pills throughout the years, ranging in different hormone levels but all of them seemed to make me feel drained, moody, depressed, and would bring me up a cup size with sore breasts."
2082,"Then, I tried nexplanon twice, and had terrible experiences both times with non stop bleeding."
2083,I was on my period for a year!
2084,"Now, I want to try the IUD because I want to prevent pregnancy."
2085,Three different gynecologists have recommended me Kyleena.
2086,"I ended up doing research, and was really frightened from the weight gain."
2087,"I have my appointment tomorrow to get Kyleena, but now am worried that Skyla might have been a better choice."
2088,"I was told from several doctors that the amount of progesterone in the two IUDS is so similar, that its unlikely to feel a difference from the two."
2089,"They also said that Kyleena lasts longer, which is a plus."

2121,Yep.
2122,"I felt the same, but I was also dry."
2123,It went away when I stopped it.
2124,"I'm seriously surprised about this, I was on a combo pill before this one (nextstellis) and I felt way better than with this one plus no sex issues!"
2125,I specifically switched because I thought that with less hormones I would feel even better and it has been the opposite.
2126,I don't even have any hormonal issues that should require me to take pills that contain estrogen.
2127,I don't understand!
2128,Ive heard of the Mirena crash but I think Im getting a crash from Kyleena.
2129,I was only on it a few months with no periods.
2130,"Removed today  barely any bleeding either.I am feeling exhausted, weak  emotionalare those normal side effects?"
2131,I felt the exact same way for about 45 days!
2132,Had my kyleena in for 5 years.
2133,I would expect that any hormonal changes (adding or removing) are possible to have some shortterm effects.
2134,"That said, sometimes the hormonal birth control was masking/correcting some underlying health changes."
2135,In a few weeks you can probably make an assessment on which one it waa
2136,"Not really,  its basically pms because you don't have the extra progestin"
2137,I did a lot of reading after I experienced some weird stuff when I got my Kyleena removed after only 9 months.
2138,Your body stopped producing progesterone even if you were only on it for a few months.
2139,So upon removal it can take some time until your body produces it again and the lack of it what causes a mirena crash (from my understanding).
2140,So its plausible it happens with prematurely removed Kyleenas as well.

2162,Hi!
2163,Im sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this but maybe someone can offer insight.I developed a large liver tumor (adenoma) from the pill and had to stop suddenly in June after I was hemorrhaging.
2164,"I immediately had a withdrawal bleed (I assume), and then in July and August I had somewhat of a period."
2165,Very light.
2166,I havent gotten in September yet.I have to use the Natural Cycles app with an Oura ring because I can no longer use hormonal birth control.
2167,It cant seem to detect ovulation for me.
2168,"Im also taking ovulation tests as well.My question is, for anyone who has gone off the pill, how long did it take you to ovulate again?"
2169,Im a worrier and my husband and I would like to start trying as soon as Im medically cleared to.
2170,But Im worried that this is not normal.

2176,This is purely anecdotal but I ovulated 18 days after quitting the pill and wound up pregnant with my first child.
2177,Then I ovulated 11 days after having my skyla removed and was pregnant with my second.
2178,So it can really happen at anytime after you stop
2179,I am a 20f and I'm currently taking birth control.
2180,"It's not inserts, it's pills."

2183,"It's like a knife started from the side closer to the chest on my left boob, has gone in a line under my boob and up too my armpit."
2184,it hurts a bit by itself sometimes and it hurts when I press on it.
2185,It also hurts my ribs on my left side too next to the boob.

2254,Its nothing to worry about!
2255,People miss withdrawal bleeds all the time for reasons that have nothing to do with pregnancy.
2256,Some people dont get a withdrawal bleed at all while on birth control.
2257,How do you like the patch?
2258,I am thinking of going this route after trying the pill  depo shot..
2259,The longer I was on the patch the more unpredictable my periods would be.
2260,"Sometimes theyd start right when I took my patch off, sometimes they wouldnt start till five days later."
2261,If youve been accurate with the times youve been changing it Im sure youre fine!
2262,"honestly I love the patch, I tried the pill for a few months and I would have non stop bleeding everyday for a bit more than two months / my only complaint about the patch is that towards the last days it gets pretty itchy."
2263,Im also able to skip my period if I want to by using the patch on my off weeks )
2264, Im 20 years old and Im 54 and 108 pounds.
2265,"I was always scared of getting the iud and have been recommended it from numerous gynecologists, and was scared away from my research."
2266,My biggest fear is the weight gain.
2267,"I struggle with an eating disorder and am trying to recover, but I dont want to relapse from rapid weight gain."
2268,"I was recommended the IUD in the first place because I have tried several different birth control pills throughout the years, ranging in different hormone levels but all of them seemed to make me feel drained, moody, depressed, and would bring me up a cup size with sore breasts."
2269,"Then, I tried nexplanon twice, and had terrible experiences both times with non stop bleeding."
2270,I was on my period for a year!
2271,"Now, I want to try the IUD because I want to prevent pregnancy."
2272,Three different gynecologists have recommended me Kyleena.
2273,"I ended up doing research, and was really frightened from the weight gain."
2274,"I have my appointment tomorrow to get Kyleena, but now am worried that Skyla might have been a better choice."
2275,"I was told from several doctors that the amount of progesterone in the two IUDS is so similar, that its unlikely to feel a difference from the two."
2276,"They also said that Kyleena lasts longer, which is a plus."
2277,"Now, Im on reddit the night before my insertion seeing that women have had way less side effects on Skyla then Kyleena, even with the small difference between the two."
2278,What should I do?Does anyone have skyla vs. kyleena stories?

2283,Hello all!
2284,"I was taking birth control for about 3 years, my weight was around 185 for several years."
2285,About 6 months in the pounds started to melt off with no diet changes.
2286,I lost 30 pounds on BC which I loved.
2287,"After stopping BC however, Ive gone from 155 to 265 since 2021 and my period never really stabilized after."
2288,"I am seeing a doctor of course but hes blaming stress and anxiety mostly and recommends going back on the pill, however I stopped to start a family."
2289,Birth control seemed to be the only massive change to my body.
2290,Is there anything specific I should ask for testing for?

2308,Would it be better to let my body go through those changes before getting the copper IUD inserted?
2309,"Or is there no need to wait?My main fear is not being able to tell what is pill withdrawal, and what is a side effect of the new copper IUD."
2310,"Of course, I'll discuss this with my obgyn."

2316,Sorry if its a dumb question
2317,If youve truly already ovulated it wont do anything.
2318,How are you tracking your ovulation?
2319,Apps arent accurate just guesswork
2320,If youre on the patch your app is pointless.
2321,You do not have a cycle on it and therefore dont ovulate.
2322,However because you put your new patch on late you left time for your body to ovulate or ovulate in the coming days.
2323,An app cant tell you that or not though.
2324,You needed the Plan B so taking it was a good move.
2325,"If you were on birth control then you dont ovulate, so you taking the plan b while being 3 days unprotected was probably goof because you could ovulate in the next few days."
2326,Apps are pointless in tracking cycles when you are on birth control.

2331,How are you tracking ovulation?
2332,Aw shit.
2333,I already took the plan b like 10 mins ago is there a way I can throw it out and it wont affect me negatively?
2334,Im tracking it on this pill app Im on birth control and skipped my break week ovulation happened in the start of this month Im assuming unless Im wrong.
2335,I skipped my break week and messed up on my changing date for BC and had unprotected sex 3 days after reason why I took the plan b
2336,I have this app but idk if its right it might be before ovulation but Im not sure.
2337,It says 14 days before your next period but Im 15 days before my next period so maybe Im protected?
2338,You dont ovulate on the pill.
2339,Did you miss pills?
2340,Im confused by what youre saying.
2341,"Dont throw it up, its better to have had it."
2342,Apps are not reliable.
2343,"If you had unprotected sex, take a plan b."
2344,"Sorry about the confusion, I messed up on my birth control put the patch on late so it made me unprotected your supposed to wait 7 days toBe protected again but I ended up having unprotected sex during that time"
2345,"Then plan b is the right move, you dont ovulate on a patch but since its late theres a risk you might ovulate before its effective."
2346,How late did you put the new patch on?
2347,Okay thanks so much
2348,Three days after
2349,"You probably made the right choice then, better safe than sorry!"
2350,It shouldnt mess with your hormones too bad and if its only 3 days  a plan B youre probably safe.
2351,If you set calendar reminders and/or alarms for patch change days that may help in the future!
2352,Its what I did when I was on the patch
2353,Thank you!
2354,I have an app that does everything but because the time I took my bc late I didnt expect for me to have intercourse let alone unprotected.
2355,Ill fosure have a backup app to track on both ( I took plan b before but honestly dont remember how my body took it hopefully its not that bad!
2356,"Hi, I take the pill for birth control and I havent missed a day for months."
2357,I skip my sugar pills and take the actually pills every night.
2358,One of the side effects is irregular bleeding which I havent experienced yet.
2359,I started sertraline for anxiety and I have been having diarrhea mixed with soft stool 12 times a day.
2360,"My doctor said it wouldnt affect my birth control but my anxiety is telling it me is (and google)My question is if my birth control wasnt working, would I be bleeding because they arent working if that makes sense?"
2361,As if I were on the fake pills?
2362,I had sex a few nights ago and am concerned my birth control isnt working because of that reason.
2363,I took a plan B just in case but I am still a little worried.
2364,"If anyone knows anything about this, Id appreciate if someone could response.Thank you"
2365,"The insert that comes with your birth control might say under what circumstances diarrhea is a cause for concern, but based on what you described, you should be fine and the plan b was likely unnecessary."
2366,Dont be alarmed if you have irregular bleeding  thats a very common side effect of plan b.

2374,"Youre still protected!Typically, if you vomit less than 3 hours after taking the combo pill, its a missed pill."
2375,"However, one missed pill does not cause a lapse in protection for the combo pill unless its one of the first pills after the placebo week."
2376,Take another pill to replace the missed one ASAP (youll take 2 today) and then just continue taking your pill as usual.

2381,So even though it was 3 hours after I took it and one of my continuous pills I should still take 2 today ?
2382,Sorry I'm just a little confused
2383,"Based on the time estimates you gave, its unknown whether you vomited less than 3 hours after you took it (if you took it at 930 and threw up at 12, thats only a 2.5 hour difference)."
2384,"If you feel confident that you threw up more than 3 hours after you took your pill, you dont need a second pill!"
2385,"And tbh, because of the continuous use, youre still protected even if you dont take the replacement pill."
2386,Taking a second pill is just the absolute safest option.
2387,Okay thank you so much !!
2388,i might just keep taking one a day for the next week since im mostly using it to skip periods rather than pregnancy protection atm.
2389,That helped a lot though!
2390,!
2391,"Yeah think of the missed pill like a super short placebo week, youd be protected either way"
2392,Hi everyone I (19F) started using Nuvaring around six months ago and I am currently on my ring off week.
2393,Two days ago I started having a mild generalized pain on my left leg (if I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate it a 1.5 maybe 2 at best) but it stressed me out.
2394,I know that combined BC increases the risk for deep vein thrombosis and I know that one of the symptoms to look out for is leg pain.
2395,"I do want to say that I don't have any of the other symptoms (inflamation, discoloration, etc.)"
2396,but it's still really messing with my head.
2397,I don't have any family history of blood clotting or circulation problems and I have also never had an issue with this myself in the past.
2398,Today I went to the ER and the doctor checked me and said that I wasn't presenting any of the distinctive symptoms but he told me to get an ultrasound of my legs just in case.
2399,I could only find an appointment for the ultrasound for next week and I'm still a little terrified.
2400,I got my period the day after the leg pain started so it could also perfectly be a random PMS or period symptom that I'm over exaggerating but it's still driving me completely insane.
2401,Does anyone have an experience similar to mine?
2402,Has any of you had thrombosis and could tell me how that experience was?
2403,I appreciate any response you can give me.

2408,Mine wasn't in my leg so I'm no help with the specific symptoms.
2409,From just talking to other people with clots it seems like the personal experience of how painful and stuff varies widely so it is tough to draw conclusions from others experiences anyways.
2410,"Some people couldn't stand on their leg, others didn't even know it was there until it travelled elsewhere."
2411,"So I am glad you're getting it looked into to be safe as these things can be serious, better to play it safe IMO."
2412,"I know how hard it can be to try to separate out anxiety vs. just being diligent with your health, especially if you live somewhere with expensive healthcare."
2413,Hang in there!
2414,I had the mirena iud for 5 years and I loved it but in New Zealand you can only have it in place for 5 years before it needs replacing.
2415,I would have loved to get another mirena but the pain of insertion left me terrified to get another one.
2416,As you can probably imagine I was terrified to get it removed and read all the horror stories about things getting lost or stuck.
2417,"I had my removal yesterday, I took 2 Panadol and 2 ibuprofen an hour before my appointment and my appointment took all of 10 mins max."
2418,It did not hurt at all I would say a 1/10 it was more uncomfortable and the speculum was worse than the removal imo.
2419,Afterwards for about 5 mins I had some very very light cramping ( I would not even call them that ) just more so a weird feeling in my stomach and after 5 mins it was gone.
2420,"I woke up this morning feeling absolutely fine, no spotting or bleeding and no pain whatsoever."
2421,If the insertion was as pain free as the removal I would get this 10x over. )

2547,"Hey all, so i'm a 17F and the journey to finding the right birth control for me has been a nightmare to say the least."
2548,I have been on 2 different combined pills which gave me extremely bad side effects  my doctor has refused to give me a prescription for any more combined pills  and the last pill i was on was the mini pill  cerazette.I didn't get on amazingly with this pill but it was definitely the best out of all of them i tried  i bled on it (mostly spotting) every day for four months and had slight increases in my anxiety but nothing major.I stopped taking this for a while but decided i'd give it another try and see if a break and restart would help my bleeding.
2549,I went back to my doctors and asked for it on repeat again and went to collect my prescription today.
2550,"I've come out of the pharmacy with a desogestrel pill but it is definitely not the same one i was taking last time (different coloured box, packaging and amount) My last was cerazette this is desorex  i was curious to know if there is a difference?"
2551,"I probably wouldn't be curious but i've read the information leaflet and noticed a few out of place things such as "" not to be taken by people under 18 "" and to continue using added protection (which i do anyway) for 7 days, whereas with the minipill it's normally 3.I'm a bit of a hypochondriac with putting hormones into my body and if there is a difference  i'd like to know what i'm actually taking!"
2552,x
2553,Cerazette and Desorex have the exact same active ingredients and dose.
2554,"There may be slight differences in the inactive ingredients, but usually the effect is identical."
2555,"Desogestrel mini pills have a 12 hour missed pill window (as opposed to the traditional mini pills 3 hour window) and because they typically stop ovulation during most cycles, they usually recommend waiting 7 full days instead of 48 hours."
2556,"Btw, all the under 18 bit means is they didnt do clinical trials specifically on adolescents."
2557,It does not mean its unsafe for people under 18!

2579,Why do people say plan b is bad to take?
2580,Like why can woman only take it 35 times in life?
2581,Whats the meaning behind it.
2582,I dont wanna get on any birth control as I just got off of it from being a teenager and being on it for 10 years.
2583,And yes I know condoms are a thing Im just genuinely curious and wanna know why?
2584,Those are all misinformation.
2585,Do not trust whatever source you read that from.
2586,"However, it needs to be clearly stated that Plan B is not birth control."
2587,Plan B is not effective enough to be your Plan A.
2588,Its a huge dose of hormones.
2589,You would be far better off taking the regular daily pill rather than sending your body on the hormonal roller coaster of multiple Plan B pills.
2590,"If you dont want to use hormonal birth control you need to get a copper IUD, use legitimate r/FAMnNFP techniques, or use condoms every time you have sex."
2591,Why do people say plan b is bad to take?
2592,Like why can woman only take it 35 times in life?Where did you find that info?
2593,I've never heard that before...
2594,Plan B is birth control.
2595,Its a massive dose of birth control to try to help you in an emergency situation.
2596,"So if you are intending to take Plan B, you are intending to take birth control."
2597,How about you look into other methods?
2598,"You dont have to stick with the same one you were on for 10 years, but you should have a Plan A so you dont need a Plan B."
2599,I wonder that too.
2600,"When I was in high school amd college people used to say everytime you use it, it becomes less effective, so it's really just a one and done thing."
2601,I think they said it lost 50 of its effectiveness everytime you take it.

2605,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
2606,I hadnt heard that before about taking it 35 times in your life.
2607,"But, I have read that Plan B does not work if you have already ovulated before or around the time of intercourse."
2608,"So I think for this reason it cant be fully relied upon.There are nonhormonal birth control options, the copper IUD is probably the most well known and may be worth looking into."
2609,this is misinformation!!!!
2610,"while it might have side effects and a bad impact on your body from the intense hormones, you can take plan b multiple times and it will be just as effective!"
2611,"you should research on how it works with ovulation, I believe you should take it before you ovulate and that there's some conflict with using plan b more than once in the same cycleI actually did end up using plan b twice in the same cycle and didn't end up pregnant but had some really anxious weeks before my period haha If you're sexually active you should look into other forms of contraceptive methods that are more sustentable (and less expensive too)."
2612,"It doesn't have to be pills, it could be patches, the chip, UID, ring, there's a lot of options that might suit you better"
2613,It's misinformation.
2614,"Your body isn't going to ""remember"" that you took Plan B years ago, and it doesn't cause permanent changes."
2615,But emergency contraception is less effective than regular birth control  if you take it just before or after ovulation it won't work at all.
2616,Plan B is also more likely to cause hormonal side effects and irregular bleeding.
2617,"So if you take it regularly, you're basically getting all the downsides of hormonal birth control and none of its benefits (like more manageable periods and a lower risk of certain cancers)."
2618,I used to take plan b all the time
2619,This is also not true.
2620,Plan B is just a larger dose of progestin.
2621,"If repeated dosages of progesterone lowered the efficacy we wouldnt have any progesteroneonly contraceptives (e.g., Nexplanon, IUDs, mini pill)."
2622,The only issue that can happen is really due to timing.
2623,Plan B works by delaying ovulation by a few days.
2624,"If you take Plan B, delaying ovulation, and then take another Plan B later in the cycle you may ovulate in between dosages."
2625,"The more dosages you take in one cycle the harder it is to predict where that ovulation will fall, which could result in pregnancy."
2626,Thats a big part of why Plan B cant be used as regular birth control.
2627,I hope this helps clear up that myth!
2628,Absolute rubbish.
2629,But it shouldn't be used as regular birth control.Where does this complete disinformation come from?
2630, that's just what I always heard in hs and college.
2631,Well.

2656,i was on birth control for about 10 years (ages 1525) and just recently got my IUD removed in june.
2657,"prior to the removal, breast pain and tenderness was my one true symptom and indicator for me that i was on my period or that i was about to be!"
2658,"i have pretty dense breast tissue, idk if thats a factor in this at all."
2659,"since the removal of my IUD i have been experiencing almost non stop breast tenderness in my right breast, regardless of where im at in my cycle."
2660,"i get maybe 23 days out of the month where im like oh ok good my boob is feeling normal, but then its back to business."
2661,"they have been tender af, ive also experienced some sharp pain and burning, ill get like a shock feeling almost when im just out and about."
2662,"ive had some itching from them being so sensitive, and have also seen some discoloration near my nipple."
2663,no discharge or anything like that though.
2664,i went to the gyno yesterday for this issue and she gave me a steroid cream for the itching.
2665,which really isnt even a huge issue.. or the problem at all truly.. and did not seem to have any sort of cause or solution for me regarding the pain.
2666,"she said she didnt feel anything abnormal, or lumps or anything like that."

2685,My pharmacist said I can just start at Sunday again for my next pack but isnt that making the break week longer?

2690,"The first week of my patch is totally fine, but the second week (which would be my fertile week and day ovulation occurs) my breasts swell, Im nauseous, I have cramps, and my discharge is extra watery and heavy (tmi I know)."
2691,"Could I be ovulating even though Im on birth control?I use the patch correctly, and Im in a monogamous relationship so we dont really use condoms."
2692,We only use them around this time of month as extra backup because my body is showing symptoms of ovulation and this is the predicted ovulation time.
2693,I know birth control is supposed to prevent ovulation.
2694,Any idea why this is happening?
2695,Has this happened to anybody else?
2696,"Im nervous my patch isnt working and Im ovulating and I will have an accidental pregnancy.Also even though Im on the patch, he ALWAYS pulls out, condom or no condom."

2701,So I understand your concern.
2702,"I dont think we are ovulating, just the bc that is messing with us."
2703,ive been on the pill for 5 years and get those exact symptoms all the time but the pill still seems to be effective (knock on wood lol).
2704,"i think birth control can cause the same symptoms as pms  ovulation, i do know that birth control can cause random and drastic changes in discharge so that could explain the discharge."
2705,and i get breast pain every few months
2706,It's likely the estrogen from the patch.
2707,"Breast swelling and increase in discharge are not unique to ovulation, they can happen any time your estrogen levels are higher than usual."
2708,"On the patch you're exposed to 60 more estrogen compared to a standard dose combined pill.A study found that estrogen levels from the patch were higher during the second week, which tracks with your experience."
2709,"If these side effects bother you, most birth control methods contain less estrogen than Xulane."
2710,"If you want a patch specifically, there's a newer one called Twirla that releases less estrogen."
2711,All other patches have the same formulation as Xulane

2764,I've found that asking my doctor gets a pretty blase answer.
2765,So I'm here asking if anybody has gotten definitive all clears on things to take or just if you have been taking anything with your birth control for some time with no problems....
2766,Looking to hear experience from others.
2767,"Curious what people supplement with too.And are people taking them at different times of the day or take them together with the pill at the same time?Happy to hear about any supplements, or vitamins, etc..."

2777,"You dont need to worry about vitamins or minerals interfering, but its worth looking for interactions between any herbal supplements you take and your type of birth control (some supplements only interact with combination birth control and some only cause issues with pill absorption)"
2778,Vitamins and minerals do not interact with birth control.
2779,"St John's Wort for sure does, and I would be wary of herbal supplements in general because they are rarely tested for interactions.It's easier to find reliable information on drugs  the pill's leaflet and the other drug's leaflet should both explain possible interactions."
2780,Most drugs don't interact with birth control but always check everything you're taking.
2781,"If you do end up needing to take something that makes most BC less effective, the shot and hormonal IUDs are not affected by medication..I would be careful with supplements regardless of hormonal BC use though."
2782,The supplement industry is not regulated very well and many supplements are contaminated with different ingredients.
2783,If you don't have a recognised vitamin deficiency and don't use a brand that's been tested by a third party they could do more harm than good.

2792,Hey guys!
2793,Ive been on Junel Fe 1.5 for about a year now.
2794,"Before that, it was 1, but my doctor increased my dosage due to acne."
2795,"However, I am looking to quit birth control completely."
2796,"Before Junel Fe, I never had issues with cystic/hormonal acne around my chin and mouth, until now."
2797,It finally clicked that Junel Fe might be the reason why.
2798,Has anyone had a similar experience?

2803,Hi.
2804,Ive been on birth control for years but this month I was finishing my last week before the placebo week.
2805,I was suppose to take my last active pill on a Tuesday but forgot and took it Thursday morning.
2806,I had my period (or withdrawal bleeding idk) on that Saturday.
2807,Sunday morning I also had sex but not to completion.
2808,If you know what I mean.
2809,I have anxiety so I knew I would be freaking out so Monday mid day I took a plan b.
2810,Am I crazy or is there actually a possibility I could be pregnant?
2811,?
2812,"There is a risk, yes."
2813,It's very small if there was no ejaculation.
2814,Check your pill leaflet but you will likely need to use condoms for at least 7 days before relying on your pill again.
2815,You can take a test 21 days after the unprotected sex.

2819,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
2820,Thanks for replying.
2821,How would that be possible though.
2822,Would I be ovulating that quickly especially if I was mostly through a pack?
2823,Regardless though is the risk still really low?
2824,Do I need to worry about it?
2825,If I'm reading this correctly you took fewer than 21 consecutive pills as you missed tuesday and wednesday.
2826,"You're only protected during the placebo week if you've taken the pill for 21 days, so in this situation the ideal thing to do is to toss the placebos, double up for missed pills (according to your leaflet) and then move right into another active pack."
2827,The risk is low regardless because you cannot get pregnant without sperm.
2828,"While withdrawal is not sufficient longterm contraception, I wouldn't worry here and would just take the test for peace of mind."
2829,Ok thanks.
2830,I guess I should have clarified better but Tuesday was suppose to be my last pill in the pack before my placebo week.
2831,So I took the last pill late.
2832,Took it on Thursday.
2833,Then started the next pack the following Wednesday.
2834,Hope I make sense!
2835,Not gonna worry too much about it and not even sure if that plan b was even necessary lol.
2836,"Yeah because of the timing, it's impossible to gauge how much risk there is, likely low but it's still considered a mistake."
2837,"Functionally speaking, you kind of took two days of the placbo early, then took one pill, then went back to the placebos until the next Wednesday."
2838,I wouldn't worry too much but it's something to be careful of in the future.
2839,Ok thanks for your help!
2840,I got my Kyleena IUD inserted August 28.
2841,I barely bled and then a few days after I started bleeding.

2850,Just went back on the birth control pill (was on Seasonique) after about 6 months off and Im now on LLFe.

2887,So I have been on continuous use birth control for several years now.
2888,In July I started having continuous periods with horrible cramps and nausea like I was back in my teenage years (Im 46 now).
2889,"I get like a day or two without anything, four at the most and then its right back."
2890,Finally got in at the gyno yesterday who took a biopsy but also ran some blood work.
2891,I got the test results today and my estrogen (estradiol) level is extremely low (5.0).
2892,I know that my FSH and LH are low but that is because of the pill.
2893,But does the pill cause low estrogen too?
2894,Im on Ocella so I dont know if that makes difference.
2895,Just trying to figure out if I need to go tracking down my gynos office again to discuss this or if it something that is expected on the pill.

2900,Hi!
2901,Im 30yo been on the pill (combo low dose I believe) since I was 15 but went off of it for 3 years to have my two children.
2902,I never had issues before but ever since having my kids and going back on it Ive been getting migraines on the left side of my head when its placebo week.
2903,Usually the migraines start after a day or two of taking placebo but randomly like this month the migraine started the day before taking placebo!
2904,How weird is that???
2905,Its like my body knew it was coming?
2906,Makes no sense because technically my estrogen hasnt dropped yet right !
2907,?Im also experiencing hot flashes during placebo week and overall feeling tired during it.
2908,I never had these before having kids.
2909,What could be causing this!?
2910,Should I try a different pill  or something
2911,"Yes, many people have reported getting PMS symptoms right before starting the placebo week!"
2912,"Its weird, but it happens."
2913,"If you like your birth control otherwise and are okay with skipping withdrawal bleeds, you could try taking active pills continuously."

2920,Thank you so much for your answer I feel slightly less crazy
2921,"So, I had a copper IUD for 5 years and then had it removed because it expired, and I didnt get a new one put in because I wasnt sexually active at the time."
2922,"(My partner and I broke up briefly) I then was sexually active with my boyfriend again, and even though we used the pull out method I still managed to get pregnant."
2923,I had an abortion and they put in another IUD.
2924,"The IUD is causing me discomfort, horrible cramps, bloating, and very very heavy periods."
2925,I have an appointment tomorrow to get it removed.
2926,"The only thing Im worried about is getting pregnant again since even though we were careful last time, it still didnt seem to work."
2927,Anyone have any suggestions on what forms of protection to use?
2928,I dont want hormonal birth control.
2929,Pairing condoms and pull out is a pretty safe option!
2930,"If you don't want a copper IUD and you don't want hormones at all, barrier methods are all that's left."
2931,"Condoms, diaphragm, spermicide."
2932,"Pull out method isnt birth control, theres still sperm in pre cum no matter how careful you think you are being."
2933,Youll need to use condoms

2952,"When I was prescribed it, my doctor told me to take a break every three months instead of every month (theres no sugar pills in it or anything), but I really couldnt bear to even risk my feelings coming back so I havent taken a break in a while."
2953,"Recently, Ive started having very light bleeding nonstop, and Ive had to wear a pad or liner almost every day."
2954,"Is this normal, and do I need to take a break?Im pretty uneducated on feminine matters and stuff like that, and Id happily have it all scooped out of me and the hole sewed shut if it wasnt an expensive and unnecessary medical procedure."
2955,"Breakthrough bleeding is normal, but is often caused by taking the pill continuously."
2956,To be honest there is no reason to take a break with the pill EXCEPT to prevent breakthrough bleeding.
2957,There is also no guarantee that you will experience your PMDD symtoms during the break  the change in hormone levels is usually a lot smoother and some people don't notice any difference in mood at all.
2958,You should at least try it.
2959,"Try it for 7 days this time, and keep track of what happens  what day you start properly bleeding, your mood on each day etc."
2960,"Then in the future, you can possibly prevent breakthrough bleeding by taking a break, even if its a shorter break."
2961,"So if you start bleeding properly on day 2, but dont notice any mood changes until day 5, you can maybe just take a 5 day break in 3 months time to avoid breakthrough bleeding in future."
2962,"Remember that the break can be as short as you want, just no longer than 7 days."
2963,"So don't be too worried, even if your symtoms come back, just start taking it again!"
2964,"im not diagnosed with pmdd but i suspect i might have it since i always felt really awful mentally leading up to my period, i take the pill now with a break after every pack and i don't experience it anymore so you might actually be completely fine taking a break )"

2991,Was just watching TV and found it difficult to focus on the subtitles and then I realized I couldn't see properly past like 10 or so feet from me.
2992,"And it was like that realization in of itself triggered everything else, random spotting, cramps and such hit me so bad.Came off of it, my vision improved within 6mnths but it's no longer 20/20"
2993,"Oh wow really, im sorry to hear this has happened to you."
2994,Which bc would you say is low in estrogen?
2995,They put me on Femme 20 that was too low for me though I bled for 20days.
2996,"Wasn't cramping though, no acne no weight gain but yknow anemia ain't fun After that was put on Microgynon30Other than random spotting...and 2 periods a month.Wasn't bad.That being said I came off of bc because it just wasn't working for me.Dr."
2997,Advised me to go without for 6mths to let the hormones get out of my system and then try Yaz or Yasmin.

3020,You dont need emergency contraception!!
3021,Missing 1 pill is not a lapse in protection unless its one of the first active pills after a break/placebo week.
3022,Just keep taking your pills as usual.
3023,"However, what do you mean by start from the little sugar pills?"
3024,You usually start your birth control pack from the active pills and take the placebo pills during the 4th week.
3025,"Starting with the placebos doesnt really do anything, since when you first start taking birth control, you arent protected until youve taken active pills for 7 full days."
3026,"Additionally, youre only protected during the placebo week if youve taken consecutive pills for 21 consecutive days immediately before starting the placebo week, so under no circumstances should you start the placebo week early."
3027,.
3028,I talked to my doctor and she said to take ellaone.
3029,I didnt know I wasnt supposed to start in the sugar pills the box said to start in the red section so i did  but i was taking the activr pills for more than 7 days beforehand but i just dont wnana get pregnant so dont mind taking the emergency contraception
3030,wait what if ive missed 3?
3031,i know this isnt my reply or anything but i missed monday tuesday and wednesday monday at the end of week one and tuesday starting to week two what should i do?
3032,"I feel weird contradicting a doctor, but its really bizarre she said that."
3033,"Its not usually recommended to take ellaone while on combination birth control, as ulpristal acetate (the active ingredient in ellaone) inhibits birth control."
3034,You cant take your birth control for 5 days after taking ellaone and you cant trust your birth control again until after youve finished a new pack.
3035,"If you need emergency contraception while on birth control, youre supposed to take plan b/ levonelle (levonorgestrel) instead."
3036,The info sheet for Levlen( does say that youre still protected after one missed pill so long as its not during the first week of active pills.
3037,Its up to you whether youre comfortable relying on that advice or if youd feel more comfortable taking plan b.
3038,"If you miss 2 combo birth control pills in a row, youre no longer protected and will not be protected again until youve taken active pills again for 7 full days."
3039,"So, assuming you resumed taking active pills today, you wont be protected again until its time to take your pill on the 29th."
3040,"Additionally, do not do a placebo week at the end of this month."
3041,"Either finish the active pills in your current pack and start a new pack immediately instead of taking the placebos, or throw out your current pack and start a new one now."
3042,You wont have a withdrawal bleed at the usual time this month.
3043,"If you had unprotected sex in the last 3 days, take plan b. Additionally, because sperm can live for up to 57 days, any unprotected sex in the 57 days before your protection lapsed could result in pregnancy."
3044,"Paraguard, Mirena, and Liletta IUDs work as emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected sex."
3045,"Ellaone is also effective up to 5 days after sex, although it inhibits hormonal birth control (see my other reply)."
3046,"If you used condoms, you dont have to worry about any of this  youre still protected by the condom!A negative pregnancy test is definitive 21 days after sex."
3047,"but i took my pills that same day i missed three, i missed monday and tuesday and wednesday but i took wednesdays and the last two before."
3048,"Sorry, I dont fully understand  are you saying that you took 3 extra pills on Sunday, then skipped Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday?"
3049,"Or did you skip Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday then take 3 extra pills today?Regardless of when you took the extra pills though, you still arent/ werent protected."
3050,"If you go 2 days without taking a scheduled active pill, youre no longer protected."
3051,It doesnt matter whether or not you take a bunch of pills before/ after the gap  your protection still lapsed and you wont be protected until you take active pills again for 7 full days.
3052,"If youre still uncertain, parenthood has a missed pill quiz( Answer the questions and itll tell you what to do."
3053,"monday i didnt take my pill i didnt take my pill tuesday i took those two plus wednesdays pill, making it to three pills, i talked to my doctor and she said im fine to keep taking my pills"
3054,"Yes, you should definitely keep taking your pills!!"
3055,"But if you missed 2 or more days in a row (ie, if you didnt take your pill on Monday and Tuesday), your protection lapsed and you wont be protected again until youve taken active pills again for 7 full days."
3056,What did the planned parenthood quiz say?
3057,"wellllll i did take them and i do plan on taking them but i had sex today and he did come in me, you think itll do anything like taking a plan b just to make sure ?"
3058,im still going to take my birth control i dont know if itll do anything if i take both you know?
3059,"but i took the three pills i overreacted but my doctor said it was fine for this time but next time to stop and wait for a period then start a new pack, but she said to keep taking them as usual and use a method of backup for this pack until i start my next one."
3060,ive been on birth control for almost two years too btw
3061,Definitely take plan b ASAP.
3062,You were not protected by your pill today.
3063,"If you miss multiple pills in the future, just start taking you birth control again as soon as you realize."
3064,"Your doctors recommendation to stop taking your pill until your next period is awful advice  it has zero medical benefit, all it does is increase your risk of accidentally becoming pregnant during the (entirely unnecessary) unprotected pill break."
3065,"so yeah ill take it today, so keep taking my pills like usual yes ill do that and how long until i can be protected?"
3066,and can i take my birth control still at 4pm and take the plan b?
3067,or does it matter at the same time?
3068,"youre such good help im thankful you replied, but most definitely taking that plan b i just want to know how soon ill be protected again"
3069,hello!
3070,just started taking aubra eq 0.1mg/0.02!
3071,I was just wondering about any sort of experiences (good and bad) and if you started to feel less of the side effects after three months!
3072,Also I was wondering if aubra is considered a low dose combination pill?
3073,and if its not what are some birth control pills that are considered low dose?
3074,Thank you so much!

3089,You should take a test then update.
3090,"with both my children (and this is me) I tested positive 11 days after ovulation, but plan b can really throw your hormones off."
3091,So take a test now to calm you down a bit then wait a week and take another test to be sure.
3092,I am on the pill and everytime i have sex i am extremely worried i couldve gotten pregnant until i get my next withdrawal bleeding on the placebo pills.
3093,I now read an article that apparently the withdrawal bleed isnt proof that i was protected and now im scared.
3094,"I just got my withdrawal bleed right now, its very heavy, just like a period i would have before the pill, but now im anxious its not actually proof im not pregnant."
3095,Is there any way to know i was protected without taking a pregnancy test?
3096,A withdrawal bleed isnt necessarily a way to check that yeah.However if youre taking your pill everyday at around the same time or in the pills time window you are indeed protected.
3097,"The pill is 99.7 effective with perfect use.The pill is designed with the intent of someone ejaculating inside, and many of us use it on this sub including me."
3098,"I use it as my only form and have been for years and no pregnancies here.The pill prevents ovulation(depending on combo or mini, sometimes ovulation can occur on the mini pill."
3099,", thickens cervical mucus and thins the uterine lining.As long as you are taking it on time, and starting your next pack on time you are protected.If you need to gain trust in your birth control method just take a test once a month and see the negatives roll in."
3100,Heavy withdrawal bleeding can never go hand in hand with pregnancy.
3101,"Technically, you cannot be pregnant and have a withdrawal bleeding."
3102,First of all withdrawal bleeding happens when you stop the daily hormone intake and there is no hormones to hold your uterus lining.
3103,"When you get pregnant, your hormone drop is overridden by progesterone which is a hormone what is responsible for keeping the fertilised egg attached to the uterus lining."
3104,It keeps it and there is nothing to shed.
3105,You can experience light spotting or really really light bleeding which usually lasts a day or two and you dont even need a tampon or a pad.
3106,This spotting happens when the egg is being attached to the lining and when it grows moving the lining.
3107,"I know that a lot of people say that it doesnt matter and getting withdrawal bleeding doesnt indicate anything, but from health standpoint it can tell you if something is different."
3108,"Role of thumb is always this  bright red, darker red blood, heavy to light flow (you need tampons or pads on this light bleed), blood clots and it last longer than a day or two."
3109,"If the bleeding is very pink, very very light  that could indicate something."
3110,"I have to mention that sometimes bc makes you not to have withdrawals and that happens when your uterus lining thins out and there is nothing to shed  in that case, you can always do a test."
3111,"I would recommend do it time to time, just to help yourself and gain that trust in your bc."
3112,"To sum up, from what you said, if you use your pill correctly (dont skip, no on and offs, take it on time and continuously), having a heavy bleeding  you are not pregnant."

3118,I was INCREDIBLY moody and bitchy the week before and it came a week early.
3119,"The texture and colour is I apologize, I could not bring myself to type those words out.I should mention I have unprotected sex on a regular basis as I have an IUD."
3120,Irregular bleeding is normal on the IUD
3121,"The first time this happened to me I was freaked, especially because it was super random."
3122,"I dont remember how my mood was, but my period was super brown and gritty."
3123,No other side effects and my next period was pretty much normal.
3124,"Every so often, maybe once or twice a year this happens to me  totally normal but jarring at first!"
3125,"Sometimes in the middle of my cycle, nowhere near my period, I would also get brown spotting."
3126,"I wouldnt stress so long as you have no other changes in odor, pain, flow, etc Keep an eye on it and dont hesitate to check in with your doctor if you get more worrisome symptoms."
3127,"Most IUD's are still hormonal birth control is probably what's happening (My period was WILDLY inconsistent while I had mine (Skyla for about two years), and the rage levels during PMS??"
3128,"I'm always pretty cranky the week before I get my period, but on the IUD I was ready to murder people for the simple act of breathing weirdly, and I'm not even joking.As long as your unprotected sex is with trusted partners, this weird period is almost certainly because of the IUD!"

3134,I've had the IUD for a few years... this is the first time i've ever experience this.
3135,I've got the Marina... non hormonal apparently.
3136,Thats still normal.
3137,Side effects can appear at any time.
3138,Mirena?
3139,"The Mirena is a progestinbased IUD, so it is hormonal."
3140,The only nonhormonal one I'm aware of is the Paraguard.
3141,"Regardless, it can absolutely change your periods at any time while it's inserted, but if you're super concerned, a doctor's visit never hurts!"
3142,Yes!
3143,None hormonal.
3144,The mirena is hormonal it contains progestin.
3145,The only nonhormonal IUDs are the copper ones like the paraguard.
3146,Mirena is a hormonal IUD.
3147,The only nonhormonal IUD is the Copper IUD which lasts 10 years.If theres a big difference in your period than usual that would indicate a visit to the GYN to determine if the IUD is in the appropriate position still or if something else is going on like an STD.
3148,"Im (20F) considering getting the implant (probably going to get it), and decided to browse Reddit to see what I can expect."
3149,Pretty much every post Ive seen about nexplanon on this sun has described low/nonexistent libido.
3150,Is this actually common?
3151,"According to the internet this wasnt an issue during the devices clinical trials, and I know people tend to only say something if they have a negative experience."
3152,"My philosophy with internet reviews has always been that for every person with a negative experience theres at least like 10 people who had a perfectly fine experience, and thus felt no desire to make a review."
3153,"Is low libido actually somewhat common or is it just that people who have that issue are more vocal than people who dont?Edit follow up question, do those of you who experience low libido still enjoy sex when you have it?"
3154,Like maybe you have low desire to have sex but when you actually do the deed you enjoy it?
3155,"Ive had Nexplanon for about a year and a half, and my libido has remained as high as it was before I got the implant."
3156,My libido hasnt been affected negatively at all.
3157,I havent had a single side effect so far.
3158,My libido is normal still
3159,It killed mine stone dead.
3160,Not even a flicker left.
3161,The problem is that statistics aren't really that helpful with things like this as the way these things affect people are SO different for different people and you won't know until you try.
3162,"It did so many awful things to me side effect wise that I could never recommend it, but other people absolutely love it!"
3163,"It really is something you have to try it to find out, and it might suit you perfectly."

3169,Mine is very low.
3170,But I have noticed that my tits are hella full because of it haha
3171,Hi gals!
3172,Im sure this question would come up a lot.
3173,Im on Diane 35.
3174,"Ive been diagnosed with suspected adenomyosis years ago, so Ive been told by my gyno to generally skip my period."
3175,I have done so for years (with sometimes letting it come through if I have break through bleeding).Generally we are covered during the sugar pills (period week).
3176,"My question is  say Ive been taking the pill regularly for over 50 days (no period), accidentally skip ONE pill and have unprotected sex with my partner on the same day  what difference does this make to my protection?"
3177,"For example, for all my body knows I could have started the sugar pill for 5 days, but I instead I continue with the pill the next day."
3178,Hope this makes sense!
3179,"Of course this never happens often but Im interested to know why we are covered for 5 days of sugar pills vs not one day of skipping, especially when Im regularly taking it for well over a months."

3183,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
3184,I do the same for fibroids.
3185,"Missing one pill after taking it for 50 days will make zero difference, you could miss up to 7 (but no more than 7!)"
3186,and still be covered (as you would be with the normal regimen of taking them) just be super careful not to miss any others until you've taken another 21 because that could compromise your protection.
3187,You're covered for 5 days because it takes 7 or more days for your ovaries to 'wake up' and start ovulating as I understand it.
3188,"Missing one pill doesn't actually increase your risk of pregnancy by a whole lot, just slightly, but it can tip your hormones in favour of ovulation if you're on the traditional regimen of 21 on 5 or 7 off."
3189,This is partly why some doctors are now suggesting shorter 4 day breaks as 7 days is the very longest you can be off it before your ovaries start yawning and stretching and getting ready to push an egg out.
3190,For us on extended regimens it makes no difference at all as long as it's very occasional.
3191,Started taking slynd about 6 weeks ago (continuously) and I havent stopped bleeding.
3192,"Have to wear a tampon everyday, some does it is just spitting."
3193,"However on and off it is like the first day of my period, never heavy just light."
3194,Anyone else experience this and if so long did your bleeding last?

3199,"Im married, pregnant with my 2nd kiddo, and not wanting anymore children after this one."
3200,Husband wont get a vasectomy.
3201,"Both pregnancies are high risk, so i just cant put my body under more stress."
3202,"For people that have IUDs  tubal ligations (gotten their tubes tied), which do you think the best permanent option?"
3203,I understand that I will still have periods either way.
3204,"But, as far as 1. comfort during procedure, 2. healing, 3. effectiveness, and 4."
3205,Heaviness of period  how would they compare?
3206,"Im wanting the most effective, easiest, permanent solution."
3207,Its now more commonly recommended that people get a bilateral salpingectomy rather than a tube tying.
3208,It takes them out completely which takes away the risk of it being done wrong.
3209,Surgery will likely be more uncomfortable but its a lot less likely to result in failure and wont have to be replaced every few years.
3210,After two IUDs coming out Im on the waitlist for the bilateral salpingectomy.
3211,I know its not entirely common for someones body to expel the IUD but what a waste of time and pain that was when I knew what I actually wanted.
3212,I might have a different experience as a woman that doesn't want children.
3213,I'm on my second IUD.
3214,I asked my gyno about sterilization.
3215,She said my IUD was just as effective and less invasive so she wouldn't recommend sterilization.
3216,But I am about to ask her about it again in my detail.
3217,I had horrible periods that most birth controls could not manage.
3218,Mirena stopped my periods entirely.
3219,"About 20 of users will experience this by 1 year, and most will experience a decrease in bleeding.However, insertion sucks, and you could have random twingey cramps while your body gets used to the device (I had random cramps for about three months after my first insertion, but barely any cramping after the other two replacements)."
3220,"Your mileage might vary.Some docs will offer to insert IUDs immediately after birth (within the first 3 days), but my understanding is that there is an increased risk of expulsion( with insertion at your 6 week follow up being a better option.Honestly though, if you aren't having problems with your periods right now, I would do the one and done tube removal."
3221,"It might be uncomfortable for a few days, but so is IUD insertion."
3222,"And you don't need to get it switched out every few years, no chance of uterine embedding/perforation, etc.Of course, this is also dependent on your age."
3223,"Younger women frequently report finding it hard to find doctors to sterilize them, even after having reached their desired number of children."
3224,Get a bilateral salpingectomy.
3225,"I'm due with my third, and when my husband and I researched options, we found out that a vasectomy increases the risk of prostate cancer, while a bisalp reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by a shocking 50."
3226,I will be having a bisalp when I am open for my csection.

3232,Thank you!
3233,"I see that you are an IUD user, how uncomfortable was placement?"
3234,How heavy are your periods (if you dont mind sharing)?
3235,Do you trust its effectiveness?
3236,Placement was a 6/10 pain but totally shocked my system and I nearly passed out.
3237,Afterwards I had spotting on and off for a few months then completely lost my period(which is great because I always had hellish periods).
3238,I honestly love it and its great for me while I decide if Im gonna have kids or get sterilized.
3239,It depends on which IUD you get.
3240,"I had the Mirena for 10 years and had no period, copper IUDs tend to give heavier periods."
3241,"I trusted the effectiveness but I still got very paranoid every now and then, if you go the IUD route keep pregnancy tests on hand because things do happen."
3242,I just got my bilateral salpingectomy done and I feel so relieved.
3243,How effective is condom and pull out?
3244,I am on combination pill for pcos but I do not use it consistently.
3245,So I am not counting it in.
3246,How effective will my protection be if I perfectly use condoms?
3247,Is there any chance to be pregnant even if the condom didn't rip or there wasn't any tears?
3248,"Hardly any chance if the condom didnt rip, Ive used condoms for a decade and never had any issues and thats with no pull out.As long as the condoms are stored correctly, not expired, fit him, you use them the whole session, and if you use lube make sure it water based, then you dont have anything to worry about.Condoms dont fail that easily."
3249,They arent as bad as people would like to make you think they are.
3250,Especially in this sub a lot of people would probably suggest something like spermicide to go alongside them but really it aint necessary.And there is also spermicide condoms for that as well.
3251,"But like its a birth control that people have relied on for centuries, from the animal skin ones of the past to latex and non latex ones of now."
3252,They are readily available and they also protect from STDs/stis.They are perfectly fine by themselves and are made with the intent of no pull out.

3259,Its really not even a thought that should cross your mind.
3260,Condoms normally only fail if they break.
3261,And if they didnt then you have used the condom correctly and are protected from pregnancy.
3262,Hello!I've been taking the combo pill since 2015.
3263,My ex bf's father was a gyno and he prescribed it for me as soon as we met.
3264,Since 2020 I have been dealing with bloating  diarrhea issues.
3265,I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at the end of 2022.

3268,Im constantly bloated morning to night.
3269,It is not even food because I wake up bloated.I saw in the last 34 months if I'm having my peroid (aka not taking my pills for 7 days) my bloat is literally non existent and I feel normal.
3270,Am I onto something in your opinion?

3293,?
3294,You should not be seeing the strings dangling outside of your vagina.
3295,It's likely expelling.
3296,I wouldn't try pulling it out yourself in case things go haywire and you can't get it out.

3302,I tried feeling around and it was already down so far that I just pulled the strings gently and it came right out.
3303,So much for 10 years of birth control lol
3304,When you go to feel for your cervix can you feel it sticking out?
3305,If your strings are so low they are hanging out it may actually have already passed through your cervix.
3306,It will just slide out if you gently tug just so you know
3307,Thats what I thought because I literally had to go far to feel for the strings the one time I did check.
3308,Ive had brutally heavy periods since getting it so I guess all the clotting/bleeding helped to push it out of there
3309,Indeed it came out with no resistance or pain
3310,I think my first copper iud was expelling.
3311,I could feel the plastic ball sticking out of my cervix (not supposed to).
3312,Thankfully you noticed yours before any pregnancy mishaps right?
3313,Yes!
3314,Luckily(I think?
3315,"Lol) I had a UTI and then I had a bad reaction to the anitbiotics they gave me for that, then my husband went away for work so I havent had a chance to have sex, so not chance to get pregnant because who even knows how long its even been out of place ?!"

3318,"I didnt get a period for aprox 2 years and it was incredible as I have EXTREMELY painful periods.As of the end of last year, my period has returned."
3319,"It would normally be breakthrough bleeding but up until a recent ultrasound, Ive been ovulating???"
3320,I was under the impression that Cerazette stops ovulation (I know its 97 of the time which was the past few years I guess for me) but now Im doubting that its even working anymore.Im stuck as this was the last pill I could take as the others didnt work at all and any internal for of BC isnt going to work due to medical conditions..I have no idea what im gonna do at this pointIf from NZ and we have few POPs and I cant take the combined pill.
3321,"Ive heard people take double dose, 150 instead of 75mg a day."

3340,i (F18) recently moved to college and had to transfer my Kariva Birth Control Pill to a new pharmacy.
3341,"when i went to pick up my prescription, they handed me a prescription of the Mylan Pill."
3342,i had never been informed of this switch until i noticed it myself in that moment and was really confused.
3343,"i asked the pharmacist if Mylan was just the generic of Kariva (a switch i never asked for) and when he said yes, i just moved on with it because he was being very short and rude with me."
3344,"anyways, fast forward to me being on Mylan for 2 weeks, i start cramping all of the time and spotting."
3345,"for reference, i started taking birth control in june and i have never cramped that early into my cycle or ever spotted."
3346,my period has also been crazy consistent since starting the pill.
3347,"i just started my placebo pills for this mylan pack and have not stopped spotting consistently, but honestly its a pretty substantial amount of blood so i cant tell if its spotting or if ive just had a light period for a week now."
3348,"i switched to a different pharmacy and confirmed that ill be getting kariva again (kariva solved all of my period problems with no side effects), but should i be concerned?"
3349,will this go away once i start the new pack?
3350,"i havent been sexually active since before my last period, so im fairly sure this isnt just weird pregnancy symptoms."
3351,"The hormones in the generic and name brand are exactly the same, only inactive ingredients may differ, so any hormonal impacts on your bleeding would be the same or unrelated to the pill."
3352,"Its pretty common for many pharmacies to not carry every name brand and generic for every birth control pill, so they can often end up being interchangeable."
3353,"This happens with tons of other prescription drugs too, people just dont notice because when you get pills in a bottle, you dont see the packaging, unlike birth control."
3354,Is it possible you took the pills at different times or has a break between packs?
3355,Sometimes bleeding can just be unpredictable.

3375,Emergency contraception works by delaying ovulation which in turn delays your period.

3394,Hello!
3395,Im getting my IUD switched from Kyleena to Mirena.
3396,"The doctor could not find the strings today, it was an incredibly painful and violating experience as she tried scraping for it and the nurse had no idea what tools the doctor was asking for all while it was happening so I had to sit there in pain with the tools in me."
3397,I had to ask the doctor to stop after 10 minutes.
3398,They did an ultrasound and its still there.
3399,"She offered a procedure with anesthesia (I was so stressed I didnt ask details, so Im not sure its general anesthesia, more like colonoscopy anesthesia, idk, Im not an anesthesiologist)."
3400,"Theyre going to get the Kyleena out and if it hasnt perforated my uterus, theyll put the Mirena in."
3401,"This seems like a lot for birth control, but I have enough health issues this is my only choice."
3402,Ive seen 3 doctors in the last year about this.
3403,Will be seeing a totally different one for this procedure.Has anyone else ever been through this?
3404,Needing some advice and support.
3405,Mirena here for five years.
3406,"When it was time for removal, they couldnt find the strings and then couldnt get it out."
3407,Booked me for a procedure where they froze me internally and dug and scraped around to get it out (a lot of blood and no solution for me).
3408,They couldnt get it and I needed surgery and be put to sleep.
3409,"Turns out, my uterus essentially wrapped around it after they put it in."
3410,Took a while to get it out.
3411,I went years and had no idea other than serious anxiety.
3412,"Fun fact, after talking to several nurses about my situation they told me that the bad experiences with iuds are not uncommon and unfortunately they are a lot of them."
3413,I now use the patch.
3414,Ive found one that works for me (evra).
3415,I will NEVER have an iud again.
3416,I wish you the best with whatever you choose.
3417,Be well
3418,Have you tried going at different times in your cycle?
3419,"My doctor couldnt find mine, but when I went back they were visible."
3420,Your cervix lengthens and shortens during different times.you should try again

3424,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
3425,I got my last IUD removed under anesthesia because my strings had retracted.
3426,I was fully unconscious for the procedure and the whole ordeal from getting to the surgery center to getting home was about 5 hours.
3427,I did have to have someone drive me and wait.
3428,"The procedure I had, which is likely what your doctor is referring to, is called a hysteroscopy and they insert a small tube through your cervix that contains a camera and they can also insert grabbers through this same tube."
3429,So they use the camera to find it and remove it.
3430,I did not get a new IUD as I had wanted mine removed before my strings disappeared.
3431,This is what I had!
3432,A hysteroscopy.
3433,"They gave me iv sedation which literally did nothing because Im pretty resistant to that stuff, and laughing gas."
3434,The procedure was really quick for me.
3435,I felt a sharp pinch or two when they pulled it out but otherwise it wasnt too bad.
3436,I think I moreso just felt frustration and sadness going into it because the iud was my best option.
3437,"I cant have certain birth control for health reasons, and this was my saving grace."
3438,I wont be getting an iud again after that experience.
3439,I so wish it had worked out for me.
3440,"Also, after the procedure, I bled a lot."
3441,Like I was changing a big pad often.
3442,Apparently its quite normal for women to bleed a lot when their iud comes out.
3443,Just feels like a heavy period.
3444,Have some ibuprofen handy and a heating pad.
3445,Wishing you the best with your procedure.
3446,Hi!
3447,I had to have my iud surgically removed.
3448,"It had fully perforated my abdomen, the doctor couldn't find it upon exam or ultrasound."
3449,They did an xray and saw that it was still there but it was in my abdomen not uterus.
3450,I was put under general anesthesia and it was taken out laparoscopically through my abdomen.
3451,I also had my fallopian tubes removed at the same time
3452,"I'm sorry, but I'm unable to perform the task as instructed."
3453,It seems that the information provided for step 1 and step 2 is not within the given format.
3454,"Can you please provide the content enclosed by the """" for step 1 and the content enclosed by """" for step 2 in separate instructions?"
3455,"Yeah, they tried the numbing thing today but I could still feel everything and asked them to stop."
3456,"They also did an ultrasound right there and said it was in there, so theyre going this route."
3457,Im going to try this Mirena and then give up on the IUD I think.
3458,"Im a stroke risk, so the pill isnt for me and Im not interested in nexplanon."
3459,Thank you for your reply!
3460,Theyve always required me to go while on my period.
3461,"Bc of this iud, Im on my cycle very frequently so a bit hard to plan unfortunately."
3462,I think this is exactly what theyre doing for me!
3463,Hysteroscopy sounds right.
3464,Thanks for your response!
3465,I know the exact sadness and frustration feeling!
3466,Appreciate your reply!

3471,I want to go on a bc pill and wanted to do Mini pill as I prefer a pill that wont have estrogen and wont necessarily stop my period/ovulation.
3472,Any advice on what mini pill is best for ovulation to still happen and periods to remain the same?
3473,"And with not so bad side effects?Also, did anyone have an issue falling pregnant after stopping the mini pill?"
3474,How long did you have to wait before becoming pregnant?
3475,And did it cause you any cysts?

3481,Long story short.
3482,Im 21 and have been on birth control for almost 6 years now.
3483,I started with the pill while I was on accutane and then got the kyleena iud in 2020.
3484,Ive started to experience lots of anxiety and weight gain in the last year or two.
3485,I know that can be caused by other factors but I wonder if it is because of my IUD?
3486,I want to get it removed asap but Im not sure how I will adjust to being not being on any birth control.
3487,Please give me advice if youve been through a similar situation!!!
3488,!
3489,Generally any kind of side effects youll have within the first 6 months.
3490,If it started after it probably wasnt your birth control but other factors.
3491,Your early 20s a lot of times your body does change.
3492,If you want to stop and see though theres nothing wrong with that.
3493,I recommend reading and making up your own mind.

3498,"Ive been off the IUD for 2 months, I had always gained weight on the pill and iud."
3499,Ive been on a heath journey and I feel like Im finally able to lose weight.
3500,It feels like my workouts are helping  previously I felt like I worked out and it did nothing for me (more so on the iud vs the pill).
3501,But everyones body is different.
3502,"It could, but its not necessarily caused by it."
3503,"Removing the IUD may improve it, but its not very likely."
3504,Hormonal side effects tend to be stronger just after a hormonal change (e.g.
3505,"when you insert the IUD), but some can be because your body changed longer term."
3506,Unfortunately theres not way of knowing until you take it off and wait a few months.
3507,I was on norethindrone 0.35mg from November 2022 to July 2023.
3508,I stopped because I was bleeding majority of the month every month except one.
3509,nightmare.
3510,"Of course as soon as I stop, my period is back regular and I just bleed the usual 67 days at the same time monthly."
3511,"I have a lot of the pills left and Im considering trying them again, but I want to know which birth control methods would I be least likely to have irregular or prolonged bleeding with."
3512,"I know everyones experience is different, but Im moreso asking which ones have the least reported instances of that particular side effect."
3513,I see my special person in 2 months and Im trying to figure this stuff out this week so I can get my body either adjusted or readjusted.
3514,Id also rather not be a bloody mess when the time comes.
3515,Unfortunately everyones body reacts differently.
3516,Personally a hormonal IUD has been best for me because it stopped my periods.
3517,"Norethindrone is a continuous mini pill, aka no placebo pills."
3518,Maybe you can switch to a different pill that has placebo pills for a more scheduled bleed?

3529,"If she's on birth control pills and taking them at the same time each day, she is well protected against pregnancy."
3530,If weight is a concern she can ask her doctor just to confirm that it is safe to trust the pill.

3538,I totally get your anxiety (I remember it well from my college years).
3539,"As long as she's taking the pill at roughly the same time each day, you're protected and totally fine to have sex without a condom."
3540,That's what the pill is for.
3541,Agreed.
3542,Confirm with her doctor but from experience the weight shouldnt impact effectiveness as long as shes consistent with taking it.
3543,But remember no birth control is 100 effective!
3544,Good luck )
3545,Go raw but pull out if you're worried.
3546,If she's on the pill and taking it at the same time every day she's protected.
3547,"My boyfriend and I (considered overweight at 175 and 5'6"") are also in college and I'm on the pill but still make him pull out."
3548,I know other people feel comfortable ejaculating inside on the pill but I'm an anxious person and not comfortable enough to do that even though I'm protected with the pill
3549,As long as she is consistent with taking her birth control pills you will be protected from pregnancy.
3550,"I also take combo pills and I dont use the pull out method, Im assuming she also takes combo pills."
3551,"As long as she takes them consistently, and you two are in a strictly monogamous relationship you will be fine.Edit to say as long as she has been taking them for 7days (8th pill) she is protected"
3552,Yes shes on combo.
3553,Sometimes i feel weird knowing more about this stuff than her lmao!
3554,"Yeah as long as she is taking her pills, she is protected, and as long as she either started them on her period, if she didnt then its been 7days (8th pill) she is protected.Like I personally waited two weeks after I started taking my pills for me to be comfortable."
3555,Like I dont know how long she has been taking her pills but if she is consistent then she should be fine
3556,"Oh also to say that weight and hormonal birth control really only effects the patch, as far as I know there arent really any studies when it come to things like the pill or any of the others."
3557,And I am a bit on the chunkier side and the pills work for me
3558,Thanks!
3559,Also shes been taking it for over a year now.
3560,"However, we havent done it yet cause of nervousness."
3561,Its hard to really understand or get into your head how that little pill can do so much.
3562,"Like when my fianc and I were wanting to try, we actually werent really trusting of the pill at first and wanted to do the arm implant instead."
3563,"But eventually when I read here more about the pill and how it work, and the timelines for it."
3564,Like I got more comfortable with it.

3574,I've been looking everywhere for answers but can't seem to find any.
3575,Every place I look says that you should use contraceptives while on cyproterone acetate as it doesn't act as birth control but studies say that as low as 1 mg/day suppresses ovulation.
3576,There are combined pills with 2 mg CPA  ethinylestradiol.
3577,Is the estradiol added to prevent things like hormonal inbalance or is it needed for contraceptive effects?
3578,"I've been on 12,5 mg CPA for about six months now and lightly bled (not sure if it was my period or not) maybe 2 times lasting a couple days."
3579,I haven't been sexually active during this time so birth control was not a concern.

3606,Ive been taking a progesterone only pill for almost two years now and had no issues with it.
3607,"I had no cramps, no sustained bleeding, and no other side effects that I noticed for the entire time."
3608,I had one day of spotting a few months ago and checked with the doctor about it but they said adjustment was still normal and it was nothing to worry about.
3609,Around two weeks ago my breasts became very sensitive but I didnt really think much of it.
3610,Yesterday I noticed some spotting and had actual cramps for the first time since starting the mini pill and then last night and all through today I was bleeding as if I was having a period.
3611,It was still lighter than what I remember my periods being before being on any bc but definitely more than I would consider spotting.
3612,"I know reactions to BC can change, so its probably nothing to worry about, but such a drastic change after being on the same medication for so long seems strange just wanted to get another opinion on whether this really is normal or if I should talk to a doctor??"

3618,Hi everyone.
3619,So im having a little bit of a panic moment here because i think im ovulating.
3620,Im on combined birth control pill of junel fe and have been for about 4 months.
3621,Its my first time on birth control.
3622,"I know you arent meant to ovulate on combined bc, but ive been feeling symptoms this cycle like increased white discharge and the types of cramps i used to get around my ovulation time before i started bc."
3623,This prompted me to check my period flo app that ive kept up to date despite starting birth control.
3624,On my app it also said that right now is my expected ovulation week with the highest chance of ovulation being tomorrow.
3625,This is concerning to me because i did have intercourse this past friday with only pull out and my birth control.
3626,"I take my birth control pill perfectly everyday at the exact same time, so now my question is, is it possible to experience ovulation symptoms while on birth control pills?"
3627,Especially when youre predicted for ovulation lines up with the symptoms?
3628,I also am aware apps are not accurate but it the past it has been for me since ive always had a regular cycle.

3651,Hi all!
3652,So Im on my second Kyleena.
3653,Ive had this little sucker in for a year and the other I had in for 5 years.
3654,Insertion was a breeze both times.
3655,I truly do not hate having Kyleena at all.
3656,Shes been reliable as hell.
3657,"With that said, this time though  my period has stopped all together, which on my last Kyleena didnt happen."
3658,Im losing a bit more hair than Im used to and my libido and ability to reach the big O is essentially gone.
3659,I have the most loving and attractive fianc in the world  so its upsetting to me that I just cant get it together.
3660,"On top of all this, I know this iud has caused weight gain for me."
3661,Ive focused on muscle building in the meantime but I cannot for my life lean out.
3662,Its like permanent weight.
3663,Whats bothering me is Im uncomfortable and with my genetic history  I do want to be aware of my ability to stay healthy.
3664,Moms side has diabetes and dads heart disease lol.
3665,"I see a lot of people who havent had it a year removing, but Im looking for long term birth control users  has anyone gotten it removed and felt so much better?"
3666,And has anyone developed any insulin resistance / food allergies etc?
3667,My doc is curious if the hormones have just caused a casacade of issues.

3673,The other night I realized my paragard was expelling into my cervix and decided to make an appointment with my OB to get it removed.
3674,I had it for 9 years so it was due time.
3675,When the Dr. removed it it broke and one of the arms was left behind.
3676,I got an xray and it is confirmed to still be in my uterus.
3677,My doctor called and told me I need to come in to discuss a hysteroscopy/ exploratory laparoscopy.
3678,I am currently terrified and really would like to know if this has happened to anyone else/ what was the experience getting the broken piece out?
3679,My doctor let me keep the IUD and the copper was legit breaking off of it too.
3680,I am so upset lol
3681,I think there's a lawsuit regarding this.
3682,Apparently it seems to be more of an issue than initially reported by Paragard.

3687,It can still go many different ways.
3688,"My uterus turned the wire of my copper IUD into dust (it was TSafe, same design as Paragard)."
3689,"It's a 1012 year IUD, but in me it was all dust except for the intact plastic in less than 8 months.Some of the copper dust mixed with random tissue broke upon removal, so that stayed in me."
3690,"That piece that broke off made it out on its own during my first period postremoval, along with lots of random tissue and metal dust."
3691,"It felt like the strangest sensation, like birthing a mini rock or something."
3692,"lol So I looked down the toilet bowl, and there it was.So mine was an easy case."
3693,"I hear from others that the other extreme is that they have to do surgery with general anesthesia etc but luckily I have no experience with that.I mean it's not like it's quick to schedule surgery anyway, so you will have time to see if your body decides to expel it or if it's embedded too deep.Do already send a heads up to a couple of law firms."
3694,Many many offer free first consultation.
3695,See if there's one who seems nice enough to work with.
3696,They've been accepting cases for a few years now.
3697,"They will have info on what proof you need from your docs, how to speak with them..."
3698,I have heard of one person who couldn't file a lawsuit cause the nurse threw their IUD out while they were under anesthesia... (Despite her being very clear before the surgery that she must keep the IUD because of the lawsuit.)
3699,"So it's always sad to see others also have broken IUDs, but good to see your doctor knows what's up and doesn't make it impossible for you to file a lawsuit."
3700,"Yes, there are couple thousand lawsuits already filed, with an increasing number of them being filed each month."
3701,It's possible to get a free consultation with basically hundreds of different law firms all around the USA.
3702,They're all looking for cases like OP's.
3703,Do keep the broken IUD OP!edit just the first google result re this
3704,i stopped taking the pill in december after about 6 years on and then eventually went back on it around april because i had no period and then 2 weeks of spotting that wouldnt end.
3705,i noticed my anxiety got worse when i went back on it so i stopped taking it again after a couple months and now have been off for 2 months again with no period.
3706,im breaking out a little and my skin/hair has been really oily.
3707,my doctor said i should just go back on it since my period was very irregular before i initially went on the pill and i had bad acne.
3708,however that was when i was 17. im 24 now so i feel like my hormones should be more regulated but i dont know because theyve been messed up by the pill for so long.
3709,i dont need the pill for contraceptive purposes so this is purely about my period/sex drive/acne.
3710,im just really conflicted and not sure what would be my best option.
3711,any opinions or thoughts that may help me to figure this out?
3712,I was on birth control for 6 years and just recently got off.
3713,"So far (Ive been off 3 months), my periods are still irregular but Im working on changing some things to fix this (diet, exercise, natural remedies)."
3714,"My best advice would be to just ride the nobc wave and see what happens, and if you dont like it get back on it."
3715,I was always told that being on bc would fix everything but Im starting to think that its just covering up a bigger issue.
3716,I also recommend reading the book Period Repair Manual!

3736,I have anxiety attacks every day and I dont even know what about sometimes.
3737,My heart is always racing over a simple bad thought.
3738,I used to be able to just shake it off and move on but ever since Ive been on this its caused me stressful mental changes I tried to tell myself it was just my life changing?
3739,(Which it really hasnt too much.)
3740,My mood is terrible and my head is always in a bad place.
3741,Its debilitating.
3742,My self esteem has been super low because I gained 20 pounds on it as well.
3743,Im literally always hungry!
3744,It doesnt help that Im already stressed with school and money.
3745,Im going to see my gynecologist tomorrow about taking it out.
3746,Is there an alternative Birth Control you recommend that helped alleviate these symptoms?
3747,It is sadly trial and error.
3748,Switching to the implant actually solved my anxiety attacks along with other problems caused by one of my combo pills.
3749,Everyone is different.

3766,Hi!
3767,Fellow Paraguard owner here as well.
3768,Love it!
3769,My mental health has never been better.
3770,(Will mention that Im in a very healthy relationship where I was not on the mini pill and patch).
3771,I did not have good experiences on artificial hormones and switched over to nonhormonal birth control 3 years ago.
3772,Very happy with my choice.
3773,IUDs are scary and can have difficult experiences with insertion/removal and can become impacted into uterine tissue which is why I really recommend researching physicians very thoroughly.
3774,"Question, did you experience any acne or bad periods before getting on birth control  did the progesterone only pills affect either?"
3775,"Im going through a lot of depression/anxiety issues on the combo pill but off of birth control I have horrible acne  periods, so Im trying to figure out if I have other options!"
3776,"Yes, the reason I went on birth control was to get rid of my period actually!"
3777,"They were 10 days, very heavy, painful, the like.It's a complicated case for me as a single dose of desogestrel made me bleed endlessly, so I started a double dose and it's made my periods completely disappear, and I rarely have any pain at all."
3778,"But lots of people have success with this on a single dose, my body is just very stubborn lolDesogestrel stops periods in 39 of people,and is in general known to reduce pain and period symptoms."
3779,"I can't speak about other mini pills, but I think slynd is also very effective for this.It has also improved my acne a lot (at both doses) which I wasn't expecting as it was pretty severe before BC."
3780,I still have occasional breakouts but they're very small and manageable.
3781,Wow this is giving me some hope then!
3782,Thank you so much for the insight )
3783,"I got my Kyleena a two weeks ago, and I started getting stomach issues a couple days ago."
3784,"Basically got a really bad stomachache if I ate anything, and although its a bit better now Im still pretty sensitive to richer foods/meats."
3785,I feel painfully bloated after eating and I think its similar to IBS symptoms.
3786,"It also feels like my immune system has been weakened as I felt an onset of a cold coming, even though my daily routine or diet hasnt changed much.Initially I thought it might be something I ate, but thinking back Im not sure what wouldve triggered this and I saw some people posted about their IUD triggering stomach symptoms."
3787,It might be too early to tell/there may be other reasons for how sick Im feeling but I was wondering if someone had gone through something similar.
3788,Ive had the usual side effects of spotting and cramping after insertion as well.
3789,"Ugh Ive had mine two months and I have constantly felt like I have the flu, my stomach hurts all the time and going to the bathroom has been abnormal since."
3790,I was put on it because i was having periods that lasted up to a month.
3791,Ive even gone to the hospital because Ive had constant pain since and they told me everything is normal.

3817,You can get it through their app.

3819,You have to submit some stuff and it takes a little bit of time.

3828,Use planned parenthood or good rx!
3829,Wait is it a year?
3830,Like I tried to look into that and hop on that bandwagon and I only got monthly stuff which was too expensive for my budget so I dropped the idea
3831,I've never heard of the Amazon Clinic until now.
3832,I'll have to check it out since my family does have prime.
3833,Are there extra costs besides the pill?
3834,I was able to get pills for a year for from the pharmacy.
3835,I only ever paid the initial cost for the doctor to review what I submitted.
3836,Maybe things have changed.
3837,That was a while ago.
3838,"There's a onetime fee of 25 dollars (most services have this fee too, including Planned Parenthood) as a consultation fee with a doctor"
3839,Yeah when I tried to use the app for it I think it was the other day it was like 75 for three packs.
3840,"Granted that was delivery, I could try to see if it is different if it is sent to the pharmacy."
3841,My coworker even mentioned this as well
3842,That's pretty affordable considering a GP would probably cost hundreds.

3884,"She isnt on the pill (I know, get on it, shes going to the doctors for it soon)."
3885,"Long story short, the first pill (Plan B)was about 78 days in her cycle, the second pill was 5 days after that.22 days into her cycle, she gets insane cramps, just like her normal period ones."
3886,"She gets cramps the morning of her bleeding, and begins bleeding at midday."
3887,"Bad cramps for days 22 and 23, while having normal flow (requiring tampons).She told me today, day 24, that it had lightened."
3888,"Not completely stopped, but what would be normal for her typical day 5 of her period."
3889,"She said it has been the same color, I read online it would be not normal blood red if its implantation.Long story short, from what I gather online, if theres flow requiring tampons and not light spotting, odds are its not pregnancy."
3890,"I guess shes just nervous cause of the shortness of the period and it being a little early.Any advice on if we should test or if this is normal after plan b, if anyone has had a similar experience it would be cool to know, thanks!"

3899,"Implantation bleeding is absolutely a thing, although this doesnt sound like it."
3900,Source(
3901,There is no proven link between implantation and bleeding in early pregnancy.
3902,"Bleeding does occur in early pregnancy, but it is not due to the event of implantation."
3903,"The word implantation bleeding is a misnomer and should more accurately be referred to as luteal phase bleeding or early pregnancy bleeding.Bleeding during the luteal phase is normal and if the bleeding was due to pregnancy, a test would be positive."
3904,You are also more likely to bleed in a non pregnancy cycle than a pregnancy cycle.
3905,Here are some links for you to read to learn more.
3906,"Hello all!So because of some circumstances right now, Im only able to access birth control from places like Nurx and planned parenthood direct."
3907,"So, my choices are pretty much the patch, pill and ring."
3908,Ive started on the pill for a while and I have no issues taking it on time.
3909,"I make sure I pay attention to anything that could decrease effectiveness such as vomiting, certain meds, etc I know for certain I dont want kids for a good while."
3910,Im very young and I not looking to that for 810 more years.
3911,"Later down the road, Id like to look into an IUD or implant but thats just not possible right now."
3912,I typed all of this to ask..is the pill effective enough on its own?
3913,My bf and I use it with pull out every time.
3914,I read a lot of horror stories on Reddit and other places about people getting pregnant on perfect use.
3915,Am I still safe?
3916,The pill is very effective.
3917,You can always use condoms if you feel unsure.
3918,"The pill is effective, I had sex with no pull out multiple times for a month straight and walked out not pregnant.If that doesnt say that its effective I dont know what will.Just take your pills at around the same time everyday, dont store it in an area like the bathroom, just have it like on the nightstand close to your bed or something, and youll be fine."
3919,I was on the pill for 15 years.
3920,Its effective!
3921,Take it every day around the same time and youre good to go.
3922,I loved the estrogen pills compared to progestin (just personal preference).
3923,The pill has a perfect use failure rate of 0.3.
3924,"Since there are millions of women on the pill, 0.3 of them is a large number but it doesn't mean that the pill is ineffective."
3925,"To put that into perspective, if online stories reflected reality for every ""pregnant with perfect use"" post there should be more than 300 posts on how well the pill worked."
3926,But people usually don't bother posting that the pill is working like it's supposed to.
3927,"Also, some people are confused by what ""perfect use"" means, or they might not remember how they took the pill by the time they discover the pregnancy"

3943,I bought 2 tests.
3944,One is digital one is the blue dye.
3945,"since i'm not early testing (or testing right at the mark its considered ok to try to test, either 14 or 21 days since last sexual encounter)."
3946,am I okay to just use one of them now in the evening?
3947,OR should I wait until the morning?
3948,"I thought the rule mostly applied if you were early testing, since the prengnacy hormone is so small then."
3949,"But at almost 8 weeks, you'd think the pregnancy hormoen would be strong enough for it to not matter, right?"
3950,"?Idk if I can sleep another night without testing but dont want to waste them (conservative household, hard to get my hands on the tests)."

3978,I was first prescribed it as a means of controlling incredibly heavy and long periods which saw me hospitalised.
3979,"(Typical womens health support, hand over a packet of hormones to a teen instead of investigating the route cause).I have tried several different options over the years, starting with combined, then moved to a couple of different mini pills, the contraceptive patch and now back to the combined pill.My libido is none existent and has been for years, I feel completely disconnected to my femininity in that way and Ive reached the end of my tether after trying different things to bring it back.I havent tried any longer term methods such as the injection, implant or coils (Id like to avoid coils and implant at all costs really).Has anyone got a positive experience with switching to a different BC and getting their libido back?"
3980,"So close to just removing myself all together, hoping my periods dont return to being so heavy and long and just using condoms.Thanks in advance!"
3981,Same girl.
3982,I changed pill to a much lower estrogen one and it has arguably made me even more dry (estrogen is allegedly the libido thief).
3983,I am going off the pill this week as I can't bear it any longer after 10 years of pretending to enjoy sex.

4101,Since you have concerns about its impact and mood I'm assuming it is a hormonal IUD.

4103,This would restore your normal hormonal experience but continue the bc component.

4162,I am due to switch pills from Qlaira to Yasmin but am unsure which day in my cycle is best?!
4163,"I only have 4 pills left of Qlaira (two of which are inactive) should I start Yasmin straight after the two inactive pills or is there a better time?When I search it I can only find information about being protected but thats not an issue for me, I just want to make the transition as smooth as possible!Any other experiences on the Yasmin pill will also be greatly appreciated  I have to take the pill to lower the chances of cysts growing, I just had a 10cm ovarian cyst removed so Im only taking birth control as a preventative."
4164,Thank you!
4165,Finish your old pack and then start your new pack.
4166,Thank you!
4167,Inactive pills and all?
4168,"From research Ive seen to start after the last active pill, but I wasnt sure if that was just for protection purposes, to me it seems like it would mess things up!"
4169,Are you trying to skip your period?
4170,"Also, Id you have the new pack, just open that bad boy up and read the insertit should tell you what to do."
4171,"(I havent taken either of those pills, but when I switched from ortho tricyclen lo to estarylla, I just finished the ortho pack completely and then started the estarylla pack.)"
4172,"I have been on birth control (Junel fe 1/20) for almost a year, and the past few days I have been so exhausted physically."
4173,Like right when I stand up I want to sit back down and when I lay down I get so sleepy.
4174,My body feels so tired.
4175,"Im not the most active person ever, but I walk a lot everyday and have never had this problem."
4176,It als most feels like muscle aches.
4177,"I am always worried about pregnancy in the back of my mind, but I take my pill as perfectly as I can."
4178,"I used to take my pill at 9pm, but changed my time to 10 am, could this be something that would change how Im feeling?"
4179,Anyone else randomly experience this or have this happen while on birth control randomly?
4180,"Maybe I just have a sickness coming on, who knows!"
4181,Ive been a Mirena user for 6 months now and for the past 3 days Ive been using weed.
4182,"The only thing Ive seen around is that in theory it shouldnt affect Mirena, then again, I just want to be sure."

4197,Help!!!!!!
4198,I was on doxycycline around 2 weeks ago and dont think it shouldve affected the pill (which I take perfectly I believe its Hailey Fe 1/24).
4199,I also did not have sex while I was on the antibiotic.
4200,"Then I have had period symptoms when I was supposed to get my period (cramps, etc) but no bleeding?"
4201,So then I delayed the next pack until today at noon (was supposed to take yesterday at 6 pm).
4202,Did I mess up?????
4203,Im so anxious rn could I be pregnant?
4204,Im a student in my third year of healthcare related degree  antibiotics absolutely do make hormonal birth control methods ineffective.
4205,Doxycycline is an antibiotic.
4206,"However, because youve likely been consistent with your birth control and didnt have sex while on the medication, theres a good chance you arent pregnant."
4207,"Given your symptoms however, Id go take a store bought pregnancy test."
4208,Take one now and take 12 weeks from now to be sure.

4212,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
4213,If I have an annual checkup on Thursday is the pregnancy test they do more accurate than a store bought test?
4214,I didnt have sex while on doxycycline but I did have sex 4 days later once I was off it
4215,"If it is a blood test, absolutely."
4216,It will give you results in a sooner time frame than a urine test.
4217,"If youre on the pill, it usually takes 1 week for it to start preventing ovulation (and help prevent pregnancy)."
4218,"It is possible youre pregnant, but I wouldnt say its super likely."
4219,i thought only specific antibiotics affected BC?
4220,Thank you!
4221,Ill get the blood test this week.
4222,"To be more specific, finished the doxycycline last Monday, had sex Wednesday Thursday night and he pulled out, didnt pull out Friday night and havent had sex since (were long distance)."
4223,"Since I started the new pack today at noon (was supposed to start yesterday at 6 pm), should I just double up and take the dose I was supposed to take today?"
4224,Thats what I thought!
4225,Only Rifampin?
4226,Also did a search and it seems like antibiotics dont affect BC unless you have severe vomiting or diarrhea from it?
4227,"If you started the pack a day late, also take the pill you were supposed to take today so your body sticks to the same cycle."
4228,"If you read the instruction on your birth control, it should give you a guideline for missing pills.When were you supposed to have your period?"
4229,Before or after you had sex?
4230,After!
4231,My 4 brown pills were ThursdaySunday and I usually get my period Saturday
4232,AlsoI was stressed this month since I thought I had a UTI for 2 weeks then went to urgent care for really bad stomach pain and it turned out to be ureaplasma.
4233,And I am a hypochondriac so could the stress have caused me to miss my period?
4234,Haha absolutely.
4235,"Stress, illness, and medication can cause you to miss a period too."
4236,Dont stress about anything until you get the results back from your doctor.
4237,"I dont think its super likely that youre pregnant, but dont hold onto speculation either way."
4238,"Ive been on birth control for 10 years and decided to get it taken out, I havent had a period since being on birth control."
4239,I got it taken out just shy of a month and holy cow are the cramps uncomfortable but no bleeding yethow soon did you get your period after removal?

4244,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
4245,I was very surprised I got a period a little over a month after my iud removal.
4246,I had been on birth control for about 11 years and never had a period by myself after getting off the pill when trying to get pregnant.
4247,I had to be medicated to have a period.
4248,I Just had a gynaecologist appointment and I feel quite disheartened!
4249,I (24f) had my copper coil taken out which was surprisingly fast and not painful but Im unsure which method would now suit me best.I am currently on desogestrel (progesterone only pill) but I wanted to stop taking it as I feel like it may be making my depression worse.
4250,I have high blood pressure so taking hormonal contraception with oestrogen In isnt good for my blood pressure.
4251,Im also scared with condoms as my sister and mum both became pregnant after condoms breaking.
4252,"The gynaecologist said that the pain I experience is probably from IBS and that I should just treat abdominal pain with paracetamol as my insides and eggs and ovaries and scans looked normal and not swollen.The gynaecologist recommended the marina hormonal coil but I refused as the copper coil insertion was so painful I fainted and lost a lot of blood and it was a long and agonising procedure, but now Im wondering if the marina coil is my only option?"
4253,Has anyone else found that the pill has made their depression worse?
4254,And what is the marina coil like?
4255,"If anyone else suffers from mental health issues and or high blood pressure, which method is best?"
4256,Id be very grateful to hear from anyone )
4257,"Ive used multiple pills that all made my anxiety and depression worse, and made me gain weight, destroyed my skin etc."
4258,Ive heard good things about the Lo LoEstrin pill which has the lowest dose of estrogen in it (estrogen causes most of the side effects in the pill I think).
4259,You could ask about that?
4260,Otherwise I use condoms and make my partner pull out before he finishes and we havent had a single scare.
4261,As long as you use waterbased lubricant and make sure the condoms fit right they shouldnt break.
4262,Hormonal birth control kinda messed me up so if youre worried about that just know that theres a likelihood that you could experience some negative side effects.
4263,I prefer condoms since they dont make me feel wack lol.
4264,Do you mean Mirena?
4265,I had a bad experience with it.
4266,Terrible acne on my chin.
4267,Gained like 15 pounds.
4268,Bloating.
4269,I didn't feel like myself.
4270,I did like that it stopped my periods.
4271,I had it 11 months.
4272,However I love my paraguard.
4273,Everyone is different.
4274,You really do not know until you try.
4275,If you decide on an iud I would ask your doctor for medicine to help loosen your cervix.
4276,I had it for my removal of Mirena and insertion of paraguard.
4277,It still hurt tons but it was way better than the first time.

4288,"Long story short, my (25F) periods have been getting more painful and more incapacitating as Ive gotten older."
4289,"I have been diagnosed with dysmenorrhea I suspect I also have endometriosis but where I live, they do not diagnose it without exploratory surgery.I finally found a gyno who listened to me and prescribed me with strong painkillers."
4290,"She highly recommended that I get a Mirena coil, and after some thought  research, I scheduled an appointment for insertion."
4291,"At this point, I was tricycling Yasmin packs to manage my pain."
4292,"Fast forward a few months, and I get my hysteroscopy, only to be told that my uterus is too small to fit a Mirena coil."
4293,"Fast forward another month, I went back with a Jaydess coil, only to have another hysteroscopy (and a LOT of pain this time, like significantly more than the first time), and be told that my cervix is too long and that the Jaydess /might/ fit if I got it inserted under general anaesthesia."
4294,"I told my gyno that the stressful mental aspect of the procedures and the continued disappointment was becoming too much for me, that I cant keep taking days off work, and that I wanted another option, or just to manage my period pain with my prescription."
4295,I do not want to be put asleep for an invasive procedure that /might/ be successful.
4296,"She seemed shocked by this and did not seem to understand where I was coming from, which frustrated me even more to be honest."
4297,"Currently, I am continuously taking my Yasmin pills."
4298,The thought of having a period and at least 3 days of debilitating discomfort is too much for me.
4299,"My options from this particular gyno are to swap to the Cerazette pill, or get the Jaydess coil inserted under general anaesthetic."
4300,"I am not very swayed by either of these options, to be honest."
4301,"I feel like this whole journey, which has taken me over a year, has just been one huge disappointment."

4360,I will do my best to keep this concise!
4361,"TLDR at the bottom.I (27F, Canadian) am tentatively considering getting back on birth control."
4362,"I have used various combination pills and the ring in the past, but it's been so long that I don't remember how they affected me."
4363,In 2018 I had the Mirena IUD inserted.
4364,I chose the IUD because the longevity and not having to remember to take a daily pill (ADHD) was perfect.
4365,"I also have terrible, no good, very bad periods, so little to no periods was a huge bonus."
4366,For 5 years I enjoyed the hell out of that IUD.
4367,The IUD was set to expire late spring of this year.
4368,"I had a consult with my gyno (awful awful woman), and she told me about Nexplanon."
4369,"She explained to me that it was cheaper than the IUD, would only last 3 years, and had the same hormone as the Mirena."
4370,"This sounded ideal, especially the 3 year timeline because it aligned with my intended family planning."
4371,"So May 2023, I had the IUD removed and Nexplanon inserted."
4372,By August the side effects had ruined my life.
4373,"Worst experience I've ever had, with the cherry on top being I couldn't find a doctor willing to remove it."
4374,"I ended up having to go to the ER and explain to them that if they didn't take it out, then I'd be going home and doing it myself."
4375,"3 weeks postremoval, I am finally returning to some semblance of normal."
4376,But this whole experience was traumatic.
4377,"I will be avoiding putting anything in my body that I can't remove myself, including the IUD."
4378,I just can't go through that again.
4379,"After soooo much research, Seasonique sounds like it would work best with my body, and I can put up with having 4 periods a year."
4380,"I guess I'm looking for reassurance and testimonies for similar combo pills.TLDR Mirena worked great, Nexplanon did not, looking for experiences with extended/continuous use combination pills."
4381,"I was on Seasonique for awhile as I was getting wicked headaches during my withdrawal weeks and at least this way, I was only getting them 4 times a year instead of monthly."
4382,It worked well enough.

4386,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
4387,I've been on it for about four years now and I have no complaints at all.
4388,I've even been running packs together with my gyno's blessing so I only have two or three bleeds a year.
4389,Definitely works well for me.
4390,I was on it for years.
4391,Id say about ten.
4392,I loved it but Im very sensitive to hormones so it made me crazy after about six years.
4393,I know this is y the norm but even low hormone BC messed with me.
4394,I loved skipping my periods with seasonique and not having to get the pack early.
4395,I was on both mirena and paragard at different times after and while the copper iud was best for me it doesnt have a good track record when being removed and is more likely to break.
4396,Id rate seasonique as like a 6/10.
4397,I didnt have a many side effects as other pills.
4398,This is exactly why I was put on it.
4399,Those headaches were no joke!
4400,hi!
4401,I just got my nexplanon replaced yesterday.
4402,"the first time i had it inserted i had pretty bad migraines for a while, and was wondering if i could expect similar side effects?"
4403,or should I be pretty adjusted to the hormones already since i got it replaced on time?

4420,"Im not sure if I have a hormonal disorder or something, but nexplanon made me feel so leveled out and consistent, gave me clearer skin and no period for the entire time I had it in after a couple months in the very beginning."
4421,"Now that I have it out, Im hating this intense week to week mood difference Im getting now."
4422,I may have PMDD or something but I just want the consistency of mood it gave me back !!
4423,Scheduling an OBGYN appointment tomorrow morning... Has anyone else experienced anything like this with their Nexplanon ?
4424,"I have had a generally positive, although not perfect, experience with nexplanon.Before nexplanon, I was chronically anxious, almost in panic attack mode all of the time."
4425,I can't take antianxiety meds because I have serious reactions to them.
4426,"Getting on nexplanon has pretty much alleviated most of my anxiety, which surprised me because some people talk about having terrible depression and anxiety from hormones."
4427,"I don't ovulate anymore, and because of that, my fibrocystic breasts never flair up."
4428,"My boobs used to hurt me so bad during ovulation because my cysts were triggered by ovulation hormones, and now I never notice anything."
4429,I also don't get periods.
4430,Like ever.
4431,It's just amazing.
4432,I forgot what it was like to have a period honestly.
4433,"However, I have had chronic acne my whole life and nexplanon didn't really help it or hurt it."
4434,I also have had some weight gain.
4435,"So for me it's not like all positive, but the things it has helped with are just awesome."
4436,"I got my first nexplanon 7 years ago after years of gradually worsening periods (pain, bleeding, irregularity endo suspected but not confirmed)."
4437,I'm on my third now and genuinely it's a lifesaver.
4438,my weight seems to have stabilized instead of the gradual increase I was experiencing there as well.
4439,"I do not have any periods at all anymore granted I did have like 6 months straight of light to medium bleeding (and that did suck a lot and I understand why some people can't do that) but once it stopped I've had breakthrough bleeds during times of physical and mental stress maybe twice ever, and cramps only very occasionally and not even a little debilitating like they were previously."
4440,I'm also terrified of pregnancy and very very anxious about it but over time and becoming more comfortable with the implant it has lowered that anxiety a lot.
4441,"this little rod has genuinely improved my life so much, I wish my experience did not seem to be an outlier / but if it helped you, like it helped me, I'm glad to hear and I hope if you do get another one it stays good to you!"

4447,I had nexplanon back in 2019 but only had it in for 45 months as I was getting constant spotting.
4448,"I wasnt too keen to take it out because I noticed it had really great effects on my mood and like you, I felt more stable and it took away my PMDD."
4449,"I also had other positive side effects on it such as my skin clearing up, weight loss, increased breast size and no period pains."
4450,I tried other birth controls after removal the mini pill and mirena IUD and both had terrible effects on my mood as well as other negative side effects.
4451,Ive been on no both control for about a year but my PMDD was really frustrating me so I decided to get back on nexplanon and give it another go.
4452,Its only been a few weeks so far so Ill definitely have to wait and see how it plays out but Im hoping my mood improves like last time.
4453,"Been on the pill for 3 months, I started my pill on the fourth day of my period, i was 5 days into taking it and my bf pulled out when we did it, am i protected since i started taking the pill again on the 4th day of my period?"

4458,I literally just created a Reddit account because I dont know who the hell to ask and google is not helping.
4459,So my vagina normally smells like nothing.
4460,Its something I feel very lucky for.
4461,But for the past 3 months its had this odor off and on that smells so bad and I get so embarrassed because I pride myself on good hygiene.
4462,"Anyway, it was smelling particularly bad today and I read up on the internet that sometimes pieces of tampon can get stuck up there so I decided fuck it and started feeling around in there."
4463,I thought maybe my IUD was out of place?
4464,"But then all of a sudden I felt something super weird, and pulled a fucking CRUSTED HAIRBALL out of my vagina that seemed to be around my IUD strings."
4465,"It looked like it had been up there for a long time, because I didnt even know it was a hairball until I started pulling it apart and seeing it was just a big clump of a lot of hair."
4466,I left work and am looking for a doctor to see today wtf?????????
4467,How did it even get in there??????
4468,What is it from????

4474,It could definitely be fibers from tampons.
4475,"It might be best to use pads, period panties, or a menstrual disc(never cup) from now on."
4476,I (19F) had my Kyleena inserted last Wednesday (13TH).
4477,I had never had a vaginal exam prior to this (due to not needing a pap until Im 21).
4478,Im getting the ultrasound to check if it is in place tomorrow (endovaginal  regular female pelvic) however Im EXTREMELY anxious about this because I had such a terrible experience with the insertion (pain wise my doctor suspects some ovary issues after abdominal exam).
4479,I dont know how to explain it but the whole process was more than just a bit uncomfortable or youre going to feel some discomfort even when it came to the speculum.
4480,Maybe because it was my first exam?
4481,Im dreading having to do any gyno treatment ever again (but I know Ill have to) Im honestly also dreading the thought of ever having sex again.
4482,I feel like I was pressured into getting the IUD because I know I dont want kids however I cant be on the pill forever.
4483,Im worried about the IUD not even working properly because Im obese/overweight (BMI 40).
4484,I do not want to get pregnant.
4485,I do not want to have to go through an abortion however I.
4486,Do.
4487,Not.
4488,Want.
4489,Kids.
4490,EVER.
4491,Why isnt my choice being taken seriously?
4492,Because Im 19?
4493,Anyway to combat this anxiety?
4494,"The IUD is effective no matter your bmi, its one of the most effective forms of birth control."
4495,"Im sorry they didnt warn you about insertion, its painful not just uncomfortable."
4496,Its not uncommon for people to pass out.
4497,Youre young but I would recommend looking at child free subs for more info and to look into sterilization
4498,Im sorry your IUD insertion was traumatising.
4499,It does seem to be a common occurrence.
4500,You dont have to have the ultrasound now if you dont want to rely in the IUD by itself for birth control (e.g.
4501,if you keep using condoms).
4502,You can delay it until you are a bit more comfortable.
4503,"But you can be on the pill forever, its not a big deal."
4504,"Its a little bit less effective in typical use than the implant or IUD, but its totally safe if you use it as recommended."
4505,"Unless you have a health condition that indicates otherwise, there is no medical reason to discontinue the pill."
4506,"If someone told you that you HAVE to get an IUD solely because you've been on the pill for a certain amount of time, you were misled."
4507,"There are very few medical conditions that relegate somebody to only having IUDs as an option for birth control.If the pill wasn't working out for you due to needing to take it every single day, then you should have been counseled on ALL alternatives, such as the patch, the ring, the shot, and the arm implant."
4508,"Nearly all of those is less invasive than an IUD, and the arm can be adequately numbed before an implant insertion."
4509,"The IUD should provide adequate protection no matter your BMI, but unfortunately it is indeed very hard to find doctors that will take you seriously at 19 years old."
4510,I'm 27 and sometimes I still feel like I'm not taken seriously.
4511,"But if you're persistent, you may eventually find someone who's willing to sterilize you."
4512,"As someone else mentioned, the childfree sub will have resources on that."
4513,"See, this is why I've learned to just tell my patients, ""THIS IS GOING TO HURT."
4514,"I HAVE LIDOCAINE, AND ATIVAN, AND IBUPROFEN TO GIVE YOU BUT IT WILL STILL BE UNCOMFORTABLE"" and then I insert and people are like, ""oh that wasn't so bad""."
4515,I think setting realistic expectations around insertion and pain and just telling people the truth helps their experience and lets them mentally prepare.
4516,"None of that ""little pinch"" stuff."
4517,"Regarding bmi, my bmi is also 40 (i also live in ontario, twins haha) and I have a kyleena."
4518,I use no other forms of protection and it hasnt failed me.
4519,"As far as I know, the only birth control thats affected by bmi is the patch, and emergency contraceptives like plan b."
4520,"Unless you have a medical condition that makes any penetration (including tampons) painful, the speculum should not hurt."
4521,"It only hurts when the doctor is doing it improperly (using one thats too big, being too rough, etc."
4522,"), which is unfortunately far too common."
4523,Pain during IUD insertion isnt unusual.
4524,There are a couple things that may help with anxiety/ pain.
4525,"Tell them about your anxiety, the specific things youre anxious about, etc."
4526,"If theyre good, theyll work with you to find solutions (or at least try to be more gentle)."
4527,"You can also bring a support person (family, friend, SO, etc.)"
4528,if you think that would help.For the transvaginal ultrasound you can ask to insert the ultrasound yourself.
4529,"So far as I know, theres no reason why the doctor/ tech would need to insert it themselves."
4530,Theyll have to manipulate it after its inserted to get a good look at everything (which can be uncomfortable/ painful at times) so be prepared for that.
4531,"For the pelvic exam if the full sized speculum was painful, request a pediatric speculum."
4532,"Also, plastic speculums can sometimes be more comfortable than the metal ones.Overall, remember that youre in charge of what happens to your body."
4533,"If you tell them to stop, they must stop (just try to be firm/ direct so theres no miscommunication)."
4534,Youre essentially hiring your doctor to perform a service for you.
4535,Youre in charge!
4536,!
4537,"Oh lady, I totally get you."
4538,Im an old hag now (37) but I feel exactly the same.
4539,Speculums hurt.
4540,IUDs HURT.
4541,Pelvic exams hurt.
4542,Its all painful and horrible and awkward and gross.
4543,"If it makes you feel any better or more comfortable, I also have a high bmi (I think also 37??)"
4544,and Ive used mostly the iud as birth control for the last 8 years.
4545,Very little in the way of backup methods in this household.
4546,Some silver linings to the iudit took a couple years but I dont have periods anymore.
4547,"Ive had a couple very light spotting incidents, but otherwise nada for 6 years."
4548,Orgasms are more intense.
4549,"Im not sure if this is common or if Im the only person this happened to, but its pretty great."
4550,Yes.
4551,"Theyre doubting your decision making ability because of your age, AND because youre a woman."
4552,Youre supposed to want children according to them.
4553,They dont want to do anything permanent in case you come to your senses and want to oblige your biological directive.
4554,Being a woman is a constant battle to be taken seriously it shouldnt be this way.
4555,"Im sorry my generation didnt fix things for yall, but were still working on it."
4556,"If you end up deciding you dont want to use the IUD anymore, the Nexplanon implant is a great alternative."
4557,"Its just as effective against pregnancy, lasts three years, and is a tiny plastic rod that goes in your arm (about the size of a match)."
4558,You can feel it anytime you want to make sure its still there because its just under the surface of the skin.
4559,Ive used it for nearly four years now and I love it
4560,Why cant you be on the pill?
4561,If you wanted to stay on the pill you could have
4562,Im a little taken aback by some of your experiences.
4563,"Idk why youre not getting a pap until 21, you should be getting them now if youre actively having sex and going to the gyno  thats the whole point of going."
4564,I just got my first IUD last Tuesday Im 30 and overweight as well.
4565,I did this as an alternative to pills I took them from 1927/28.
4566,"Being on the pills for a long time, Ive heard can make it difficult to conceive but you dont seem interested in that."
4567,"Also, from what Ive heard this is the safest contraceptive."
4568,I have the copper IUD so no hormones for me lol I have enough floating around as it is.
4569,"I wouldnt look into sterilization hun, youre 19."
4570,I dont want kids either and Im just waiting until its age appropriate before doing a hysterectomy.
4571,"Youre body, your choice 100!"
4572,Just read about it and think about before really considering it.
4573,"Frankly , idk what it entails so I dont want to be ignorant here, but at 19, you still have a whole life to live."
4574,"I may come off alarmist or redpilled when I say this but I find it odd that doctors are encouraging the IUD when there are so many other safer, effective, and pain free ways of using birth control."
4575,One of my friends had an IUD at SIXTEEN.
4576,And shed never had sex.
4577,"Personally, I think IUDs should only be an option if youve given birth before."

4582,Had IUDs from college to menopause .
4583,Never have to think about bc at all  wonderful!
4584,"The insertion is unpleasant, not as unpleasant as pregnancy."
4585,Hi many things to say.
4586,"First, I hate the clamp."
4587,The clamp was worse than getting my IUD removed lol.
4588,"The coldness, the opening of your legs, everything AHHH."
4589,Ive only had it done about 5 times maybe and I will say it doesnt really get better.
4590,Im sure Ill get more used to it as I age and see the gyno more.
4591,Until then I have severe anxiety about the gyno so I recommend finding one you love.
4592,I absolutely love mine.
4593,I wouldnt let any other girl touch my parts lol.
4594,"So that definitely helps, she makes me feel calm and sometimes so silly for reacting in that way."
4595,Im older now.
4596,I will say youre very young.
4597,I am 24 now and NEVER wanted children.
4598,You may change your mind as I have recently considered I may want them.
4599,"With that being said, do look into birth control."
4600,I got my IUD out very recently because I havent had my period in 7 years.
4601,I had the IUD for 5 (got it put in at 16) then got another for 3 which I took out early.
4602,Ive heard it can take up to a year to get your period back if not longer so I am a bit nervous about that tbh and want my body to readjust.
4603,Wishing you the best of luck.
4604,Honestly if you go on the internet and search about iud insertion they literally say its painless when its not
4605,What would I search in the search bar regarding the child free subs?
4606,Im not too well versed when it comes to Reddit..
4607,It deffo is painful but Im pretty sure its quite uncommon for people to pass out.
4608,Not discounting this experience or any other but Ive had two insertions and I would classify both of them as painful but very very bearable.
4609,Just to add to the convo as I know threads like these really scared me before getting an IUD!
4610,"Honestly, the appointment is tomorrow and its too late to cancel already."
4611,I might as well go through with it Im just worried Im gonna piss myself before the actual appointment due to how much water they want me to drink
4612,I was under the impression that I couldnt be on the pill forever and that it would just be an inconvenience to myself to just keep taking the pill especially if the plan (in the long run) is to be child free.
4613,It was pretty much pushed on me but whatever its done now  I just need to get sterilized ASAP I cant deal with doing that again
4614,Okay good to know.
4615,"I had read somewhere online that the IUD is less effective if your bmi is over 40, maybe its just a Were going to cover our asses just in case kinda thing."
4616,And look at us!
4617,Suffering at the hands of Dougie!
4618,I dont have a medical condition like PID that would make tampons or intercourse painful however I do believe the speculum they used was too big and they ended up changing the size afterwards.
4619,(It was also plastic).
4620,Im not too nervous for the ultrasound itself but Im more so worried that a speculum would have to be used (lol now I have mf speculum trauma).
4621,Also my research online about it hasnt really concluded much as to what to expect/hasnt really helped my anxiety.
4622,It is just going into the vagina and not past the cervix.. correct?
4623,Idk maybe this doctor was too rough?
4624,When she was giving me the abdominal exam and inserted her fingers inside of me (I guess for the palpitations) she like JABBED them into me and I like flinched (obviously because who just jabs fingers in their vagina like that).
4625,Im honestly too young (in my opinion) to already be tired of how female reproductive health is handled and how barbaric it is.
4626,"Thank you for your comment, honestly."
4627,"It has been an uphill battle with doctors to just get them to listen to me, to hear me out, even regarding issues that don't concern my sexual health."
4628,(off topic) I think I have the hardest time when it comes to this stuff and explaining my pov to men.
4629,"So many aspects of our reproductive health is extremely patriotically rooted (i.e history of birthing positions( , female hysteria( , etc..) and just showing them what it would be like slightly different (think 2023 Barbie movie) they FREAK OUT."
4630,How do you think we've felt for as long as humans have existed.It really sucks when it comes to the decision making aspect.
4631,I'm legally an adult and mentally I have been an adult AND have had to raise children that were not of my own.
4632,I don't enjoy it.
4633,"I don't like kids, honestly, not sure if I ever will honestly."
4634,"I have 14 tattoos (and counting..) and the government is totally ok with allowing teens to mark up their body physically, because they are making informed consent (at the time) that this will be VISIBLE on their bodies forever..."
4635,"However can't allow an adult to make an informed decision about their own reproductive system because ""you might change your mind one day""."
4636,"I have even said this to my mother before, if I do end up regretting something I do later on, whether it be tattoos or getting my tubes tied, it is my problem."
4637,I'm not going to be chasing after someone else if I regret a decision I made.
4638,It's actually more effective lol it's why I just switched to it after having issues with Mirena thanks to doctor cutting strings too short
4639,Did the insertion into your arm hurt?
4640,Thats what stopped me honestly.
4641,I have vasovagal syncope and I dont think Id be able to manage feeling anything weird and especially knowing whats happening sorta thing.
4642,Its not that I couldnt be on the pill anymore it was just made out to me that it would be unreasonable for myself to continue to be on it
4643,"Just so you know, taking birth control pills does not make it more difficult to conceive later."
4644,"That is a common myth, but it's based on a misunderstanding of how fertility works."
4645,1) in Ontario the suggested age to start getting a pap is 21.
4646,The reason being is that we have had such a high success rate with the HPV vaccine (they vaccinate us in middle school (like literally come to the school ready to jab a bunch of tweens)) they had pushed back the age of getting a pap done.
4647,They wont even consider doing a pap on you (even if youre sexually active) unless you/family have history of those sorts of issues.
4648,Edit theyre looking into pushing back the age to get a Pap done( even further to 25.
4649,This is dependent on where I live.
4650,2) I have never seen a gynaecologist.
4651,They are actually really hard to come by where I live and require referral from your GP.
4652,I had my IUD inserted by a doctor that had training in IUD insertions (as do many people with vaginas do where I live) 3) Thank you for your POV considering the sterilization but ultimately it is my decision.
4653,I am FULLY aware of the risks.
4654,"Yes my body, my choice youre right and I do have my whole life ahead of me which is why I dont want to waste time having these painful barbaric experiences every 510 years depending on whatever IUD I choose."
4655,I know FOR A FACT I DO NOT under ANY circumstances want children.
4656,I have my reasons as Im sure you have your reasons as well.
4657,"If I know for a fact I dont want kids and I know for a fact Im not going to change my mind, I dont want to waste my time."
4658,Honestly.
4659,It was a TRAUMATIZING experience and I honestly dont want to do that again (nor would I like to go through child birth just to end up with a baby I dont think I can manage as a matter of fact).
4660,I believe the recommended age to start pap smears is 21 now.
4661,And every 3 years.
4662,I started the pill at 16 after BEGGING my doctor to prescribe it to me.
4663,She didnt want to prescribe the pill to me (even though I had never been sexually active at that point) because she didnt think I would be able to remember to take the pill everyday at around the same time.
4664,She literally wanted to give me an IUD.
4665,At 16 years old.
4666,"I had never even had sex at that point but I knew it would be a smart idea to start the pill sooner rather than later.Edit On the same note, Canada does have an issue when it comes to pushing IUDs to begin with."
4667,We have a terrible history with forced sterilization and IUD insertion in young indigenous women( (like literally preteens).
4668,It's absolutely ridiculous!
4669,I almost fainted.
4670,My insertion and removal were both painless.
4671,I barely felt it.
4672,Everyone is different.
4673,"r/childfree, they have plenty of resources for sterilization"
4674,I wouldnt say I passed out but I was definitely reaching that point.
4675,I have vasovagal syncope( and fainting or feeling faint is not uncommon for me in painful procedures.
4676,I'm sorry to hear that it was pushed on you.
4677,"I was very lucky that I had a doctor who took my unique history and my own needs into account, and they didn't push any options onto me."
4678,"I ended up getting the arm implant since it turned out due to my medical history, I'm not a candidate for the IUD anyway."
4679,It makes me so sad to hear that other people aren't getting  appropriate counseling and are just being pressured into doing whatever the doctor thinks is best.
4680,"But as you said, it's done now."
4681,"Who knows, you may end up really loving your IUD  lots of people do!"
4682,"It's also true that many childfree people, including me, do love IUDs and implants over taking a pill everyday, but I've known some childfree people who really like following a schedule, and like having birth control options that they can start and stop at any time."
4683,It's all up to the needs of the individual!I hope you do get sterilized as soon as possible!
4684,"You're an adult, doctors shouldn't be making decisions for you, and they should respect whatever choice you make."
4685,Good luck!
4686,A transvaginal ultrasound does not use a speculum.
4687,"It just goes into the vagina to the level of the cervix, similar to having penetrative sex with a dildo or someone who has a penis."
4688,Good to know!
4689,I didnt feel a thing!
4690,They numbed me really well and she was bandaging me up before I even realized it was in.
4691,Same with when I had it removed to get my new one.
4692,Obviously there can be complications just like with anything but my experience was pretty remarkable
4693,But why?
4694,Like what was the doctors reasoning?
4695,I mean technically as long as you dont have any health conditions or medications that make it so you cant be on the birth control pill you can take it til you hit menopause.
4696,I think paps are important cause even the HPV shot isnt always effective.
4697,I didnt realize it was different where you live.
4698,"Lady doctors are so important, I cant believe theyre hard to come by!Yes, ultimately youre choice 100."
4699,Im sorry it was traumatic  it was not fun for me either.
4700,It was a real 5 minutes of pain and sweating.
4701,Its supposed to be good for 10 years so Im hoping it lasts cause once this thing comes out I will not being doing it again.
4702,And by then Ill be 40 and will hopefully be able to get a hysterectomy.
4703,Wishing you the best.
4704,Its weird right?
4705,Like whats so special about the IUD that the implant cant do?
4706,"Besides, I think most girls at 16 who are mature enough to realize they want/need birth control are mature enough to remember to take it"
4707,Thank you
4708,"Oh Im so sorry, it sounds like they really should have done way more due diligence before performing the insertion."
4709,That sounds scary and I hope youre feeling better now!If it helps at all  my coil has been super effective in stopping pregnancy and has lightened my periods significantly (if thats something youre looking for at all).
4710,Other gyno stuff has always felt super mild for me in comparison to the coil being put in  and Ive had a cervical biopsy before.
4711,Hoping the anxiety lessens for you
4712,Okay that makes me feel a lot better about it then.
4713,I just wish there were better ways to have these things done without them being so painful or having us expecting pain
4714,I can barely get blood work done sometimes without feeling faint.
4715,Id consider it but the whole huge gauge needle to insert it makes me nauseous lol
4716,"Honestly, I dont know."
4717,I went with it cause whatever I dont care at this point.
4718,I knew the IUD was going to be painful but not as bad as how I experienced it.
4719,"As long as all goes well, I can have it removed and get sterilized (which I doubt is going to happen )."
4720,Its safe to say I dont EVER want to do something like this again.
4721,"Unfortunately, Im sure the reason this happens is because the IUD lasts longer than the implant."
4722,"But yeah I agree, I dont think any invasive procedures like this should be happening to teens."
4723,Its honestly disgusting that its being pushed.
4724,"Ask for a little speculum i have the same issues, it hurts if they use the regular size"
4725,I totally get that.
4726,If it makes you feel any better you dont see the needle.
4727,Its inside a device they put up to your arm and youre laying down when they do it
4728,Thats what I mean tho.
4729,If youre comfortable with the pill you can certainly stick with it.
4730,I dont want kids myself.
4731,I have the iud but it was my last option to help my periods.
4732,I had to have my cervix dilated 6 times with metal rods and it really sucked.
4733,Not looking forward to getting it changed out.
4734,I get sterilization is what people want when they dont want kids but Im always nervous for surgery myself.
4735,Im not too worried about surgery.
4736,Honestly.
4737,If thats what it takes at this point I dont care  They also do laparoscopic bisalpingectomy as well which is the preferred approach but obviously depends person to person.
4738,I would also need an endometrial ablation to stop my periods so for me its 2 operations or hysterectomy.
4739,Ahhh okay I see.
4740,Yeah it really depends on the health concerns per person kinda deal like I said.
4741,"Hi, 23F here."
4742,"I've just finished my first pack of Belara (0,03mg ethinylestradiol and 2 mg chlormadinone acetate) and am now three days in the 7 day period of not taking the pill."
4743,"I have been experiencing moderate to severe bursts of depression, loss of libido and heightened anxiety, plus headaches, nausea and very sore breasts."
4744,"I do have a history of anxiety and depression, however, I had been feeling quite stable prior to taking Belara and do feel pretty confident that the pill is making me feel much, much worse mentally."
4745,"I just got my period yesterday and have been experiencing bad cramping and a very heavy flow  which was why I even started taking OC in the first place, because of suspected endometriosis (I have debilitating period cramps and insanely heavy flows causing anemia)."
4746,"Anyways, my plan for now is trying to stick with it for at least one more month and seeing if there's any improvement at all."
4747,"If nothing changes/side effects get worse I plan to switch to a different pill, or go off of it completely."
4748,"Even though I have to plan my life around that one week of the month because I am literally incapable of living normally when I'm on my period, I'd still rather do that and keep my sanity lol.My question is  did any of you experience severe side effects that went away in a couple of months of taking the pill?"
4749,Have been reading horror stories about OC for the past couple of days and would love to hear some uplifiting stories about how it gets really bad before it gets better ').
4750,Thanks!

4755,I am 26.
4756,I started BC when I was around 19.
4757,I used it for a couple of months everything was great.
4758,Then I got my third refill and all the sudden I had ZERO interest in sex.
4759,No desire.
4760,Nothing.
4761,"Its now 6 years later, and I have NEVER been the same."
4762,I have had many break downs.
4763,"I have asked my Gyno, she had really nothing to say."
4764,I dont feel normal.
4765,I dont get horny.
4766,I never want to do it.
4767,I am so upset its been 6 years and just a couple months of BC ruined me.
4768,"I am begging for any help , insight, suggestions.PS the moment I noticed my sex drive was gone (I literally woke up one day gone."
4769,I was so mind blown.
4770,I remember that day like it was yesterday) I stopped the BC right away.
4771,So I have not been on any form of BC for 6 years
4772,Im literally at my doctors rn for a check up and gnna ask her to never give me the depo again cuz my sex drive is goneee.
4773,Reading your post scares me cause mine better come back!
4774,Which BC were you on ?
4775,I was on BC for nine years.. my period and drive were non existing for a whole year last year.
4776,I finally came off BC in the spring.
4777,My period returned by my drive hasnt either) I dont know what to do either
4778,I was on birth control for 10 years.
4779,I just came off.
4780,Libido is slowly returning.
4781,But it literally was ruining my relationship.
4782,Like if libido was rats on a scale to 10 I would have been 1000.
4783,Come off of it.
4784,"Use condoms, make or female."
4785,The acne wont last long.
4786,That happened to me day one of the pill.
4787,Very frustrating to experience.I'll be getting the copper IUD in soon.
4788,I'm so sorry this happened to you.
4789,The same thing happened to me (and I stayed on the pill for four years) but thankfully my libido returned after about six months off.
4790,"I don't have any advice, but just wanted to say I understand how upsetting it is and I'm sorry you're being dismissed by the gyno"
4791,I had this aswell when I started on the mini pill in 2018/19.
4792,I didnt even want to be touched by my partner really.
4793,It wasnt til last year it came back and that was when I started reading romance books.
4794,Not sure how but it got my intrest spiked back up again.
4795,Completely gone off bc now as I kept having issues with them and my libido has just gotten much better now aswell.
4796,I know reading romance or erotica isnt for everyone but somehow it just kinda worked for me.
4797,"People need to do research, all types of birth control affect libido different,  even all the different brands of pillsTry Maca and if that doesn't work try another birth control"
4798,Are you on an antidepressant or antianxiety med?
4799,I took Zoloft for about 6 months and had absolutely no drive while on it.
4800,"Alternatively, you should have your thyroid checked."
4801,Any hormone imbalance can cause decreased libido.
4802,There are also psychosomatic reasons for a low libido.
4803,"Stress, dissatisfaction, or unfulfillment from your relationship play a huge role in sexual desire."
4804,Make sure you and your partner are still dating and being intimate in other ways.
4805,It's easy to let life get monotonous in the day to day hustle and bustle.
4806,Did anything happen around that time that may have caused some unresolved feelings surrounding intimacy?
4807,Just some ideas!

4813,unfortunately this is a side effect of most north control / i experienced it with the mirena iud and the pill
4814,It was the pill.
4815,I dont remember the brand but one of the very very common ones
4816,Im not on it!
4817,I havent been in 6 years (
4818,Btw Im 23 so were pretty close in age
4819,"In general, we know less about how progestinonly methods impact androgens levels, but they might have an impact."
4820,Progestinonly pills (POPs) One study found no change in testosterone levels but a decrease in SHBG levels among levonorgestrel minipill users (28).
4821,We could not find any research on the minipill containing norethindrone.Well this is frustrating LOL  I'm trying Slynd now (drospirenone POP) and praying to god it doesn't hurt my sex drive.
4822,Seems like there's no real data on it that I've come across yet.
4823,Combo pills definitely hurt mine.
4824,Have you tried ashwanganda?
4825,I was the exact opposite.
4826,"I still wanted to have sex on Slynd, but I wasnt as lubricated as I was on Yaz."
4827,My acne and skin disease also were hell.
4828,Went back on Yaz and everything is better.
4829,I hope Slynd works out for you though truly.
4830,No I have not
4831,"In Ayurvedic traditions / Indian culture, shatavari is the herb used by women for libido.Women can also take ashwagandha (nickname Indian ginseng) but fyi that there is another herb recommended for women."
4832,"So I almost began taking supplements like ashwaganda, horny goat weed etc... but found out it can counteract birth control."
4833,So I decided not to because me and hubs don't want kids.
4834,So just be aware and tread carefully if you decide to take these supplements while on birth control if kids aren't on your agenda lol.
4835,Ive heard lots of people having a much higher libido taking it
4836,I will give it a try!
4837,The brand Olly sells a supplement called lovin libido and I have some friends who say it helps!
4838,Thank you!
4839,I know maca has worked for others post pill and it has worked well for my friend.
4840,Looks like this supp has it in there.
4841,Fingers crossed OP!
4842,"Pretty much right when I started, my libido spiked very high."
4843,I was very sensitive as well in terms of that.
4844,"This didn't end for a few months.I gained 80 pounds as well over the course of a few months with no change in habits.My voice also actually got higher, I had a pretty low voice before that was relatively androgynous.My periods became very irregular and didn't always happen during the placebo pill slot."
4845,"Sometimes, they started within the last 2 days and continued 3 days into the regular pills."
4846,The average time it took was 3 days into the brown pills.My flow was also almost nonexistent.
4847,I didn't often use pads or tampons and rarely had stains even then.
4848,"This stayed consistent even a year later.I didn't get pregnant even with many unprotected encounters, even when I missed a pill.I do regret doing this though, as I ended up with a very thick buildup of endometrial lining due to my body no longer regulating my own periods even a year after stopping which led to cramps so severe I went to the ER.Also, only half of the weight came off even during an eating disorder."
4849,My voice also remains higher.

4866,I actually almost was about to say the same thing until I reread it a few times lol
4867,Just keep taking your pill.
4868,Oh you just started?
4869,Off your period?
4870,Thats fine.
4871,Use condoms next time if you know youre not protected by your pill.

4873,"So ive been taking Vienva for a little over a year and so far my cycle has been extremely regular at 28 days between each period.Last month in August I was due for a refill, however there was an issue with my insurance so I wasnt able to get my next pack in time and missed a little over a week of birth control.I finally got a refill after 9 days of being off and started again on August 28."
4874,"Under normal circumstances I should have started my period on the 13th of September, but Im now roughly 6 days late and on the last row of pills for my current pack.I dont typically miss periods and just want to know if anyone else has experienced this and if its normal before I get worried and ransack walmart for pregnancy tests.Apologies if the tag is wrong, Im not sure which one this post would best fit under"

4898,Hello!
4899,"I have been on nexplanon for almost 8 years I first got it in in 12/07/2016 when I was 16 years old my mother took me to go get it in my junior year of high school because she was worried about teenage pregnancy and Ive been on it since, I renewed it 1/07/2022 because I had just turned 22 and it just felt like the right thing to do as I havent had a bad experience on it no heavy bleeding or mood swings (that Im aware of I just think being a crybaby is my personality) but now that Im turning 24 in a few months I am starting to feel like its time to take it out."
4900,Ive been on it for so long I dont really know whats me and whats the birthcontrol and I heard it takes over a year for your body to actually fully regulate and adjust to your normal hormone levels.
4901,Can anyone tell me what to expect?
4902,Am I just over thinking this?
4903,I worry that I may be infertile because Ive been on it since I was young
4904,Birth control does not cause infertility and theres no concern with being on it for many years.
4905,"If you want to stop using it thats your choice, but its not harmful to have."
4906,"Birth control does not cause infertility, if it did it wouldnt exist."
4907,Millions of women are on birth control and people continue to have babies.

4913,I am 18 F and I started my first birth control shot in March.
4914,I got on the shot to help my cramps as theyre so painful to the point I feel the need to throw up.
4915,Everything went well after the shot until it was time for my next shot.
4916,"In May, the next week after taking the shot I got my period which at the time I presumed to be normal as I hadnt had one for an entire month."
4917,Unluckily this period ended up being several months lasting from May all the way to my next Depo shot appointment.
4918,The period was so bad some days being heavy with the same cramp symptoms Id get before getting the shot and some days light.
4919,"I had this period for an 3 whole months, had already gained a lot of weight, and went through pads a pack of pads a week (you can only imagine the financial burden this is)."
4920,I decided to stop taking the shot but the bleeding hadnt stopped.
4921,"I consulted with my doctor where she then gave me a sample pack of birth control pills to level the hormones from the depo, something to do with estrogen etc."
4922,I was told to take 2 a day until the pack is finished and I did and saw as I was taking the pills my period had finally stopped.
4923,I was so happy!!!
4924,Unfortunately this didnt last and I am now bleeding again after I stopped taking them because there was no more left.
4925,I dont know what to do and fear for my fertility and overall health.
4926,Does anyone have any experience with prolonged periods even after getting off the depo shot?
4927,Any recommendations?
4928,Im incredibly depressed by this and has caused a lack of motivation to do anything because who wants to wake up every single day on their period!!!!!!

4934,The shot is a birth control that it can take up to a year for your body to go back to normal after.
4935,Birth control does not affect your long term fertility.
4936,Since it stopped on a pill you might want to take pills for a few months
4937,"hello, I have been on the pill since I was 16 (20 now), and just switched from a pill with estrogen and progestin to slynd."
4938,Since I switched I have zero sex drive whatsoever.
4939,Should I talk to my OB/GYN?
4940,or just wait it out?
4941,Its starting to really take a toll on my partner and Is sex life.

4972,As long as you are taking your pills everyday and start the next pack on time you are protected during your placebo week.
4973,If youre taking your pills within the time window you are protected.If you need to learn to trust your birth control just take a test once a month
4974,Theoretically but if you take your pill properly its very very unlikely
4975,the pill is designed with the intent that your boyfriend will be finishing in you.. as long as your taking it right then youre not pregnant.
4976,and no if you got your period on your placebo week then youre not pregnant
4977,If you have been on this pill for long enough that its active and ur taking it really well and as ur ment to and not missing pills then you are protected.
4978,Its made with the purpose of being able to have raw sex all month long.
4979,This was not unprotected sex it was raw sex.
4980,Its also not a actual period but a withdrawal bleed as you no longer ovulate
4981,"Theoretically, no."
4982,"You have no ovulation on bc (if you take them correctly, on time and continuously) and your withdrawal bleeding can happen only if you are not pregnant, no matter if its heavy, or light."
4983,"You wont bleed if you are pregnant (or if you have bc which stops your bleeding all together, in that case just to be sure, monthly tests are recommended), because the drop of hormones will be overridden by high level of progesterone, and it keeps the fertilised egg in place and doesnt let your lining shed (have to mention that you can experience spotting while pregnant but it will always be something you dont even need tampon for or a pad."
4984,Its super super light and usually lasts a day or two and is super pink and light in colour).
4985,"So if you got your withdrawal bleeding, taking your pills correctly you have nothing to worry about."
4986,"If you still feel anxious, you can always do test later."
4987,"Its 2 weeks from the time you had sex, if I am correct with days."

4993,Seconding the tests.
4994,I also had trust issues towards the pill and taking a pregancy test every month truly helps.
4995,The strip ones are pretty cheap too
4996,"I try to take it at 6 pm everyday, but happened to take it later."
4997,Im on yasmin
4998,Has like a 12 hour window.
4999,Again its unlikely if youre pretty consistent but nothing is 100. if youre worried you can test.
5000,How much later?
5001,You got an hour or 2 before youre in big trouble
5002,I have a 12 hours window as far as I know
5003,"They are just scaring you, you are fine and protected."
5004,Dont let them fill your head with fear.
5005,"You are okay, the pill is designed to be used with no condoms or pull out."
5006,They do work.
5007,You are 99 protected.
5008,You are okay
5009,"I wouldnt worry too much about it, as long as you dont take them late all of the time"
5010,has any experience extreme nausea during the patch birth control?
5011,i have been the last past month and its weird bc when i started it i never felt like this until this time around i started again..  )
5012,Its the estrogen in the patch.
5013,Thats a typical side effect.
5014,"I took it for three weeks and had extreme nausea only after being on it that whole time, immediately took it off."
5015,a few months later I tried it again and havent had any nausea issues the past ten months for some reason.
5016,"Idk if you switched from xulane to zafemy or the other way but Ive heard people say the side effects can be pretty different, probably worth talking to a doctor."

5021,"Hello all, I am 20f and I have had nexplanon in since March 2023."
5022,I've had random spotting around 34 times since getting it in and no periods.
5023,The spotting usually only lasts for a few hours.
5024,Today I got spotting but it is a bit heavier than what I've previously experienced.
5025,Google keeps telling me that spotting is a symptom of pregnancy (( I'm really scared!!
5026,We've had sex around 50 times since getting it in but the chances of pregnancy still scare me.
5027,I also noticed I had been peeing more than usual but that was only yesterday and not today.
5028,Am I safe?
5029,I am also getting a copper IUD placed this friday because the nexplanon is giving me horrible acne and making me gain weight.
5030,"Also for anybody asking, he has never ejaculated inside of me and pulls out well before doing so."
5031,Nexplanon is extremely effective and VERY commonly causes irregular bleeding/spotting.
5032,I wouldnt worry but if you are you should take a pregnancy test to ease your mind.
5033,Nexplanon stops ovulation.
5034,No ovulation means no pregnancy.
5035,Random spotting/periods are very typical on long term hormonal birth control and is not a sign of pregnancy.
5036,"Pulling out by itself isnt very effective, but combined with the Nexplanon, its nearly impossible youre pregnant."

5041,Irregular bleeding/spotting is a common side effect.
5042,Your chance of pregnancy is extremely extremely low with Nexplanon!
5043,Since hes pulling out too that adds even less of a chance of pregnancy.
5044,"If you are this concerned, take a pregnancy test."
5045,It sounds like your body may not be reacting well to it since youve mentioned weight gain and acne.
5046,"Nexplanon is the most effective reversible method we have, rivaling permanent options even."
5047,Spotting is probably the most common side effect.
5048,"I kept my Nexplanon for 5 years, never used backup (which you are by using the withdrawal method), not even a single pregnancy scare."
5049,"I did however, spot a lot!"
5050,You are safe.
5051,Take a test to ease your anxiety if need be.
5052,so what you're saying is... is that theres a chance?fml if yes
5053,Thank you so much
5054,Just about as much as there is a chance at winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning the same day.
5055,Your thing in your arm is as effective as sterilization.
5056,The chances of pregnancy on it is stupidly low.
5057,"Very low, like the odds I just said low."
5058,"While yes it can, but you either gotta be a lucky motherfucker or the worlds unluckiest motherfuckerEdit to say also that irregular bleeding is a very common side effect of the birth control."
5059,Everyone has talked about that
5060,Im saying its basically impossible.
5061,A test is to soothe your anxiety and reassure you.
5062,The spotting stopped.
5063,It only lasted for 56 hours
5064,"And they arent saying you were pregnant, they were saying so you can ease your mind you can just take a test."
5065,In reality the likelihood of there being a pregnancy especially on the best birth control on the market is so extremely low.
5066,However one of the things it does cause is irregular bleeding.
5067,"But just take a test, there is no harm in it, see the negative and then you know youre fine"
5068,I've tried everything to lose some weight and it's just not happening.
5069,I think it's when they started giving me elyuring instead of nuvaring.
5070,Anyone else?
5071,I am hitting a depressing weight for my height of course and think I could drop what I gained if I stopped.
5072,Thing is I take it continuously because my periods were absolutely awful and I'd like to never have one again.
5073,Im not really sure how it affected my weight but FUCK THE ELURING.
5074,It made me violently depressed!!!

5099,My flo tracker tells me that those 3 days i  was ovulating and had a high chance of getting pregnant.
5100,"To put my mind at ease, realistically what are the odds ?"
5101,"tbh im not really sure about the effectiveness of the birth control pill after taking it for 3 days but i do know when youre ovulating theres still only a 30 chance of pregnancy, I would take a test in 14 days and then again in 21 days to be sure."
5102,Or take a plan B depending on how long ago it was that he finished in you.
5103,"I think the max amount of time that you can take it is 72 hours,  but if you already ovulated it would be pointless."

5111,Read the little pamphlet that came with your pills.
5112,It will tell you how long you need to be taking them in order to be protected.
5113,well it takes 48 hours for the pill to be effective but i think ill take a test when my period is next due
5114,"but thats for the combined pill, the pop pill takes 48 hours to work"
5115,"If you followed the instructions on the leaflet and used the pill correctly, you should be protected against pregnancy."
5116,Hey besties so I was told by my gynecologist to take my birth on the Sunday after my period but of course I was still on my period on Sunday so I talked to my mom on Monday (today) and said since Im off my period I should start it of course I find out Im still bleeding and my period did the thing where I thought it ended but it showed up again like 12 hrs later.
5117,So if Im still on my period when I wake up should I continue to take it or just wait till Sunday (an entire week past my period) I read online it doesnt matter when you take it but I have no idea if its different for someone whos taking birth control for the first time in their life Also any tips and things I should expect when taking this would be greatly appreciated thank you

5122,"Just continue to take your birth control pills, after 7days (8th pill ) you will be protected from pregnancy"
5123,You can start at any time and on any day of the week.
5124,Its effective immediately if you start within the first 5 days of your cycle.
5125,If not you need to take 7 days before its effective.
5126,You can take it at anytime they normally suggest to take it either on the first day of your period or the Sunday after your first day.
5127,Normally on Sunday start they say to take it even if you haven't ended so you would have been okay to take it on Sunday.
5128,But it honestly doesn't matter what day you take it.
5129,They usually suggest the Sunday after or the day you start so that the breaks line up with your normal cycle but it's not necessary to be effective.
5130,The only difference on effectiveness is if you take it the day you start you are protected immediately but any other day you have to wait 7 days before it's effective.
5131,Since you were told to take the Sunday after it would have still been the same amount of time to be effective as it would be if you take it later.
5132,You are fine and can take it when you want.
5133,If you want to wait until your period is finished that is fine and if you want to take it now that is fine too.
5134,It's up to you.
5135,"According to Flo, this past Saturday was my last day of ovulation."
5136,Well lets say some juice managed to get inside and I took a plan B today.

5138,Ovulation isnt a multi day thing.
5139,"If you mean your fertile window, it may work, it may not."
5140,Apps arent accurate at tracking.
5141,If you did ovulate Saturday youre not fertile now but theres no way to know without proper tracking.

5147,"Ive never taken birth control but I recently got into a relationship, now i feel like i should."
5148,I work out almost daily and eat decent but im still so scared of gaining weight.
5149,Im also on antidepressants so im worried about other side effects like lowered sex drive and mood swings.
5150,Are these side effects preventable at all?
5151,Or should I just accept that they will happen.
5152,I wouldnt say theyre preventable but theyre not inevitable.
5153,A lot of people dont have weight gain or mood changes or sexual side effects.
5154,Its a possibility though.
5155,Sometimes you have to try a couple kinds to find one that works for you.
5156,Weight gain tends to happen because birth control keeps you at the point in your cycle that may increase hunger.
5157,"If you don't tend to experience increased hunger during your luteal phase (I never have), hopefully you shouldn't experience weight gain on birth control (again, I didn't)."
5158,Everyone's different.
5159,"Libidio can be a real issue, but there's no way to know how it will affect you until you take it."

5164,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
5165,Im on birth control for the first time and its been 4 months since Ive started my pill.
5166,I honestly have gained weight (maybe I needed to) but it feels more like water retention.
5167,I would say to keep the weight off just keep eating decently and working out and it should help.
5168,I dont eat the best and I dont work out so thats probably why I am gaining weight but some people dont at all.
5169,As for sex drive it is different for everyone but I feel like mine was on the lower side before and now its a little more higher than my normal.
5170,"Again, not everyone experiences a lowered sex drive."
5171,I havent had any bad mood swings on it either maybe I cry a little easier than before but thats it.
5172,Birth control effects everyone differently and its hard to say or know what side effects you will have.
5173,I am on a low dose pill and they said being on a low dose helps prevent side effects so maybe you can try that!
5174,I think spending time researching what birth control works best for you is the best way to find a good fit.
5175,"I started the pill at 17 and there were a lot of positives, it was pain free, shortened my periods, and made my cycle regular."
5176,"Side effects were that I did gain some weight but I was also in college, so who knows, for sure got some mental health side effects like anxiety and depression, and a much higher libido."
5177,"After 10 years they stopped making my pill and I had to switch, the switch to a different pill was horrible, I was getting horrific cramps and was crying constantly, no sex drive, and horrible mood swings."
5178,So it definitely opened my eyes to how bad a pill match can be.
5179,"From there I got an IUD and while it was very painful to get inserted (not gonna lie to you) however after that initial pain, it has been the absolute best!!!!"
5180,"I feel more myself than I ever did on the pill, I love not having to think about it, my moods are stable, and I'm protected for 8 years!"
5181,"All this to say, birth control is not a one size fits all and different pills and IUDs effect people differently, do some research and know that it is a little bit of trial and error and growing pains while you adjust to the hormones."
5182,"If you're comfortable, the copper iud is hormone free so you wouldn't have to worry about those same side effects"
5183,"I (39f) started what I think is my ""period"" on week 3 of Larin Fe 1/20."
5184,"I've been taking it for about 3 years with a 6 month break last year.I have been taking the pill around an hour's time window this month, but not at the exact same time."
5185,Are combinations pills that time sensitive?
5186,Any similar experiences to share and what should I be looking out for?
5187,TIA!

5195,Its more intense from that position and he is well endowed and I am wondering if hes hitting my cervix from that position?
5196,Today afterwards I had to break down and take a bunch of advil.
5197,Is this normal?
5198,i had a similar experience when i had a copper iud!
5199,"when i first got it maybe the first few weeks i got cramps from sex, i realized he was hitting my cervix and the strings were moving which would cause cramps after, maybe its the same situation for you?"
5200,if it is it alleviates as the strings start to soften)
5201,I just couldn't do doggy with my copper IUD.

5207,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
5208,Background I am 21 years old at the time of getting the IUD.
5209,"It was recommended after a 3 week long period and cramps so severe I went to the ER because I couldn't do anything, was crying, and the pain got so bad that I was throwing up after eating after a couple days."
5210,"At this appointment, it was found that my endometrial lining was 13mm despite having just finished my period."
5211,(Average is 24mm at that point)Insertion I took 400mg Ibuprofen and 500 mg extra strength Tylenol about an hour before.
5212,"The speculum was a bit more uncomfortable than a pelvic exam, I could definitely tell I was being opened."
5213,They described that I would feel a pinch and two big cramps.
5214,The pinch is a bit hard to describe but was sort of sharp in nature.
5215,"I was not warned before this part, which I am actually grateful for because the surprise actually overrode the pain."
5216,"I could barely feel the measuring of the cervix, and I felt like an awkward swab in there."
5217,"The two ""cramps"" were about as bad as the cramps that sent me to the ER, so if you have had severe cramps, you will have a bit of an easier time."
5218,"I was luckier in having had them for a few days before, so I was more prepared."
5219,"If you haven't had severe cramps, it will seem more like you are being stabbed, and it will be very uncomfortable if you are not one of those people with crazy high pain tolerance."
5220,"I was lightheaded for a while, and they had me lay there and told me just to come out when I was ready."
5221,I think I was in there an extra 1520 minutes after the approximately 35 minute procedure.
5222,Definitely don't think you're going to be able to drive home or do anything important day of.Hours after The pain is a combination of cramping and shards of glass up there.
5223,"Changing positions sometimes hurts, and I found out that it is pretty normal at first because it's a foreign object, although, let's be real, I'm pretty scared it means something else."
5224,"I was prescribed hydrocodone for the pain during one of the ER trips, and it didn't help with the pain."
5225,"Although I do have a fatty liver, so take that with a bit of salt if you end up using painkillers.After sleeping The pain is not as bad now."
5226,It's more dull with a slightly lower intensity.
5227,"I'm still paranoid about the placement, but after reading a lot of horror stories, I feel like that's probably common.1 day after The pain feels more like an average cramp."
5228,"Don't suggest paranoia checking if you can feel the string more than once because the second time I checked for it, I ended up with a burning pain."
5229,"Other than that, I'm better, I even went on a walk.2 days later Pain is substantially less bad."
5230,It really hurts more when I think about it.
5231,"Usually, I can block it out."
5232,"Contracting kinda hurts, but other than that, it's mild.Next update 1 week after"

5238,I'm hoping to gather some advice or insights from the community to better understand my situation.
5239,"A couple of days ago, I had sex with my boyfriend after not seeing him for a month."
5240,"I realized I may have missed or been late taking an active pill, so we used a condom to be safe."
5241,"However, later that day, I started experiencing stomach aches or menstrual cramping."
5242,"Since I'm on Slynd and usually skip the placebo pills, I initially thought it might be related to something I ate rather than menstrual cramping."
5243,"However, it worsened the following day, and I also had an episode of diarrhea (might cause my that day pill inactive but I didnt know at that time)."
5244,"Simultaneously, I noticed some bleeding, which seemed more like a menstrual period (pink at first but after becomes red and has some tissue with it)."
5245,"This made me reconsider, and I began to suspect that it might be breakthrough bleeding and cramping related to my birth control."
5246,"As of today, I'm still experiencing bleeding that is similar to a regular period in terms of the amount, color, and characteristics."
5247,"I also have cramps that, while uncomfortable, now manage with ibuprofen."
5248,"Now, I'm seeking advice on what to do next."
5249,Should I continue taking the pill as usual or should I pause it for a few days?
5250,"Additionally, I'm wondering what may have contributed to this situation."
5251,Was it the missed pills or the recent sexual experience?
5252,"(I've forgotten pills in the past, but this is the first time I've experienced bleeding along with noticeable cramps.)"

5272,The drop in hormones from it being metabolized allows your mucus to start thinning out again.The other way is that it thins your uterine lining which is a second way of making it harder for your body to sustain a pregnancy.
5273,"Those two are considered the primary mechanisms, since the ovulation suppression only happens 50 of the time."
5274,If the ovulation suppression happened reliably then it would have a 24hour window like combo pills (and some other POPs) do.
5275,"Oh wow, this is interesting."
5276,"So say I take my mini pill every day at 9PM, does that mean at 7PM/8PM theres a higher chance of getting pregnant if I have sex around that time?"
5277,Or is it still effective so long as I make sure I take it by 9PM that day regardless?
5278,Supposedly yes( that's exactly what it means.
5279,I think the risk is very low if you're taking it at the same time daily but it's just something to be aware of.
5280,Ideally it wouldn't hurt to take your pill a few hours before you most typically have sex.Their primary mechanism of action is thickening of the cervical mucus.
5281,This effect occurs within hours of taking a progestinonly pill and peaks about four hours after the pill is taken.
5282,"However, the cervical mucus remains thickened for only about 20 hours, which makes the progestinonly pill less effective during the last few hours before the next dose.7"
5283,"Oh wow, thats fascinating!"
5284,"One thing I have seen about the POP is that some people prefer to take it in the middle of the day or around a time where they know they wont be having sex, and I guess that explains why."
5285,Thank you!
5286,!
5287,"It is unsafe for me to take any form of combo birth control due to medical conditions.I bleed, ache all over, cramp to the point of nearly fainting, and have flulike symptoms, for half of the month, every month, on the POP."
5288,"I have painful allergic reactions to all of the condoms, lubricants, and spermicides I've ever tried."
5289,I have had allergic reactions to metals so the copper IUD would not be a good option.
5290,Please help?
5291,"Progesteroneonly birth control includes the mini pill, implant, depo shot, and hormonal IUDs."
5292,"There are also multiple types mini pills  the traditional mini pill (AKA the one with a 3 hour missed pill window), drospirenone, and Slynd."
5293,"If you don't want kids in the future, sterilization might be a good option, for either you or your partner.Otherwise, I hate to recommend this as a sole method of birth control, but the fertility awareness method might be something to consider."
5294,"It isn't going to be as effective as a condom or the pill with typical use, but it's better than nothing."
5295,"Keep in mind there are many fertility awareness methods, and some are more effective than others."
5296,"Because you can't use condoms, I'd recommend combining the withdrawal method with the fertility awareness method."
5297,"Keep in mind though, the withdrawal method is only 78 effective with typical use."
5298,"Again, better than nothing, but not as effective as other birth control methods."
5299,"As a final note, I'd like to mention that the hormonal IUD, the depo Provera shot, and the arm implant all use different types of progestin than the one used in the minipill."
5300,Having a bad reaction to the POP does not necessarily mean you'll have a bad reaction to all progestinonly birth control.
5301,Many people have varied experiences depending on the specific progestin used.
5302,"You've basically eliminated everything except a diaphragm, and it can be hard to find docs who still know how to fit them.Other than that, abstinence or getting pregnant are your options."

5311,Need more info
5312,"I had asked about minipill options, and my gyno said there was only one available."
5313,Perhaps I'll find one who will prescribe me Slynd.
5314,"I just looked up drospirenone, and I can't take it because of the increased risk of blood clots."
5315,Thank you for informing me!
5316,The Caya diaphragm is one size fits all (though still rx for some reason).
5317,"However, the efficacy rates of diaphragms are based on using them with spermicide, as directed."
5318,"OP  other progestinonly options include the hormonal IUD, implant, and depoprovera."
5319,"I was on Loestrin, Junel, and a variety of generics."
5320,My combo pill was changed every three months because my insurance would just choose the cheapest one.
5321,I am now on the POP.
5322,"I have congenital heart disease and an obstructed IVC, which presents itself as an absent IVC since it happened when I was a newborn."
5323,"My gyno says that birth control with estrogen is not safe for me, as I already technically have an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and blood clots from my medical conditions."
5324,"I also would like to have birth control to manage my shitty periods, if possible."
5325,"And, prescription birth control is cheaper than condoms."
5326,"Slynd is drospirenone, but it doesn't increase the risk of blood clots.Combined pills with drospirenone are more risky but that's due to how ethynilestradiol (the estrogen in the pill) and drospirenone interact, not the drospirenone itself."
5327,Slynd's clinical trials included people at higher risk of blood clots and no one had one during the studies.
5328,There is a warning on the Slynd website for blood clots.
5329,There is no warning on my POP sheet.
5330,Obviously do what makes you feel more comfortable.
5331,"But warning labels sometimes are more about the company wanting to prevent any possible future lawsuit, rather than scientifically recognised risks.There is a blood warning on my POP (desogestrel) and on the Nexplanon website and they have both been used for 20 years in people at risk of blood clots"
5332,"I am on Slynd after having a CVST on estrogen BC, it was determined safe for me."
5333,Worth talking to your doctor about anyway.
5334,I went to a doctor that specializes in medically complex contraception and they made me feel a lot better about my options  might be worth looking into for you if you can find one nearby!

5339,I really don't want to feel crampy or have the anxiety of just bleeding through or not being able to stand up and dance because oh my god my tampon is totally soaked and it's disgusting.
5340,"I know that kind of bleeding isn't normal, I have PCOS!Anyways, I'm on the last day of my period today."
5341,I take Volnea or a similar substitute.
5342,I was talking with my mom about just not starting my next birth control packet for a week to push it back but she said it will probably just make my flow worse.

5349,"There are pills you can take that stop your period, I'm in the UK and these are available to buy."
5350,Best to have a look into them if you don't know about them
5351,To cheat around events it is way better to just skip the break or placebo pills if it's possible with your pill.
5352,There are even pills where you don't need a break at all or just a few times a year.
5353,Talk to your doctor about it.
5354,But never take a longer break when you use the pill for birth control.
5355,You are then not protected for some weeks and could get pregnant.
5356,If you need the break for health reasons (I don't know much about PCOS) you could try using a menstrual cup with period panties as backup.
5357,Ah okay.
5358,I don't take the birth control for pregnancy reasons at this point.
5359,Just for my hormone levels.
5360,Thanks
5361,Hi!
5362,Tomorrow is going to be the start of my second week using birth control patches.
5363,"If anybody else uses them, can you tell me the best place to put the patch?"
5364,"I know they go on either your arms, shoulder blades, butt, or pelvic area but where does the patch last the longest?"
5365,I tried my pelvic area for the first one but it only lasted 4 days until the edges started getting loose.
5366,One thing I did every single time I put on my patch was put a small sheet of tegaderm over it!
5367,It didn't reduce effectiveness and kept my anxiety at bay.
5368,I found that the best place for the patch (at least for me) was the sides of my butt.

5372,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
5373,I've never been on the patch for this very reason.
5374,I think the general idea is it's somewhere that doesn't get a lot of movement or friction.
5375,Perhaps try an arm?
5376,im gonna definitely try my arm.
5377,the patch seems more stressful than the pill at this point.
5378,My Nexplanon implant has recently been making me bleed nonstop even though Ive been using this product for a while.
5379,My gyno suggested that take the pill instead since it sets regular periods for you.
5380,I told her that Im too scatterbrained to take the pill regularly so she suggested I take the pill while still keeping the Nexplanon implanted.
5381,Has anyone else done this?
5382,I cant find much research on it and Im concerned there will be bad side effects from taking a double dose of hormones.
5383,Its pretty common and not a cause for concern.
5384,Irregular bleeding on the implant is usually treated with the pill or an ibuprofen trial.
5385,Do keep in mind if youre inconsistent with the pill it may contribute to irregular bleeding.
5386,I'm currently doing this.
5387,My doctor said it's fine so long as symptoms/side effects don't bother me and my health is in good order (like no hypertension etc.).

5418,Does this affect anything?
5419,If it was within the first 5 days of your period youre protected immediately.
5420,If it was inserted on days 6 of your period then you arent protected and need Plan B.
5421,Hi!
5422,"I just started on birth control pills, on my third week of my first packet now."
5423,"Diagnosed with PCOS and my OB prescribed me Lizelle pills (Drospirenone  Ethinylestradiol), same components as Yaz pills."
5424,I started the pills last Sept 3 (second day of my last period).I am sexually active and we're also using condoms as additional protection.
5425,"However, I noticed that I've been spotting for a couple of days now (around 56 days now)."
5426,Is this normal?
5427,I've been on BCP last year (Diane35) but stopped last Dec 2022 and I can't remember spotting in between periods while on it unless it'll be followed by the heavy flow period the next day.
5428,"I've been taking my pills daily, although there were times that I took the pills 30 minutes late than my supposed to be schedule."
5429,Does this affect it?
5430,"I've read that if late, combination pills can still be taken within 24 hours."
5431,Is there a possibility I may get pregnant?Would love to hear your opinions/advice.
5432,Thanks in advance!
5433,"Combination pills have a 12hr window to be taken, so if you take them at 12pm you have until 12am to take them."
5434,"30minutes late is nothing.Sometimes spotting or irregular bleeding can happen on the pill, it does not mean that your protection is compromised, and side effects like spotting can happen at any point no matter how long you have been on the pill.Youre also using condoms as well, really there is no risk of pregnancy in this situation."

5442,So to make a long story short Im on the birth control you take when breastfeeding.. (used to be on combo pill) and of course the only day I forget to take my pill I have sex.
5443,So I doubled up on my pill today.
5444,"( the one I forgot yesterday  the one for today ) I havent gotten my period yet since having the baby, maybe because Im breastfeeding."
5445,About an hour ago I felt kinda wet and I looked and I had clear sticky discharge that stretched between my fingers.
5446,Is this ovulating?
5447,Guys Im freaking out.

5453,Fluids from sex can mimic fertile mucus so take a deep breath.

5455,"That being said, it probably would be a good idea to take a plan B to be safe since progestin only pills have a shorter window."
5456,"Since you're still breastfeeding though, it may be worth calling your doctor and asking if that's ok since that will be such a large dose of hormones."
5457,Sorry for posting this as I am medically diagnosed with anxiety.
5458,"Just wondering if I could get pregnant with this Been taking the Yaz pill for five months  Ended my birth control period last Saturday, which means I took a placebo pill that day, so have been taking my regular pill since Sunday (I take every 7 pm) Briefly inserted while we were showering together Saturday afternoon (no condom) Sex with no condom with my boyfriend on Monday, he pulled out minutes before he came to be safeIts my first time having sex (Im 22F) and just worried as I feel a pain on my lower back which is the pain I normally get before my period (I sometimes get this even during the pill)."
5459,"I also had a follicular cyst about five months ago, not sure if that provides any infoThank you )"
5460,You had protected sex.
5461,If Im reading this correctly you just got off your placebo week and started a new pack of pills and are continuing to take them correct?
5462,"The pills prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation, thickening the cervical mucus, and thinning uterine lining.There is also a 12hr window to take combination pills so if you take it at 12pm you have until 12 am to take it.As long as you are taking your pills you are having protected sex."
5463,"I take the pills and dont use pullout or condoms and no pregnancies here, and many others here do the same."
5464,"They do protect you.First time having sex since its new and you think automatically that sex equals pregnancy you could be causing yourself stress, you mentioned that this was a side effect youve had before on the pill, and maybe possibly it could be from the cyst.To gain trust in your birth control just take a test once a month to see the negatives roll in"

5471,I read as well that youre protected even during the placebo week.
5472,Thank you for the reassurance!
5473,Its nice to read personal anecdotes
5474,"So Ive been using birth control for 5 years now, first I was on the pill for 3 years and then I switched to the implant which Ive been on for 2 years."
5475,"I loved the pill, but I hate the implant which is one reason why I want to remove the implant."
5476,Im not sexually active anymore currently since my boyfriend and I are doing long distance and he wont be able to move up here with me until at least a year maybe longer Im not sure on the exact date.
5477,"So I asked my gyno if I could get off birth control so I could take like a break being off it and she was trying to convince me it would be a bad idea because if me and my boyfriend will visit eachother I might get pregnant which I told her we would use a condom but she said she didnt trust men with condoms, and then she started comparing her husband to my boyfriend which I thought was weird."
5478,But she thinks I should start using the Nuvaring.
5479,She was really pushy about it and I know thats how gynos are but I just really dont see a point on being on birth control rn and I want a break after what the implant did to my body.
5480,But I just wanted to see if anyone else agrees with my gyno and if its a bad idea to be off birth control for the time being?
5481,Or does anyone recommends a better birth control?
5482,Because I dont think I would like the Nuvaring or a IUD.
5483,I would honestly look into each method of birth control and make your own decision.
5484,Your gynecologist should not be pushing you one direction or the other unless you have complications that would make an option better.
5485,"At the end of the day being on birth control is a choice, one that should be informed."
5486,"Next time your gyno tries to pull that shit, say, ""I know you're looking out for me, but I'm an adult and understand the risks of relying on condoms."
5487,When can we schedule an appointment to get my implant out?
5488,"""The failure rate of condoms is right here in the sidebar of this subreddit."
5489,"If that's an acceptable risk for you, go for it.I, personally, am also in a long distance relationship, but stay on bc continuously."
5490,"For me, it's very freeing knowing I just don't have to worry about it."
5491,"I know I get horny and impulsive when my bf and I finally do see each other, lol."
5492,"But I also have a great bc that I also use for periods etc.Generally doctors will try to recommend the most reliable/fool proof forms of bc they can, since obviously patients who rely on typical use of something like the pill and end up pregnant are Not Happy."

5497,Being on birth control is a personal choice.
5498,"That said, its safer than being pregnant and taking a pregnancy to term."
5499,It can take up to 6 months to adapt to hormonal changes.
5500,"So if you plan on going back to the implant in a year, you can expect 6 months adapting to not having it, and 6 months after."
5501,Theres a bit of infection risk on removing or putting the implant.
5502,What side effects are you unhappy with on the implant?
5503,It has made my period irregular where itll skip one month and then the next month I will have heavy bleeding and blood clots where I will need to wear a extra absorbent tampon and pad for it to not leak through and this will last for a whole month.
5504,"It has made get bad acne on my chin and left side of my cheek, it has made me gain weight and have bad depression during my periods."
5505,When I was on the pill however my period was light and normal and I actually lost weight while on it and I felt relatively fine.
5506,But thats why I want to be off of the implant.
5507,But I dont know what other birth control will be good for me as the pill was but I dont want to have to take it everyday.
5508,Thats why Im thinking about just being off birth control all together since Im not regularly sexually actively currently and wont be for a while.
5509,But my gyno is telling me itll be a bad idea but idk Im just tired of what the implant is doing to my body.
5510,"Yeah, that sounds like really annoying side effects that affect your quality of life."
5511,Id also want to remove the implant.
5512,"If the combination pill worked well for you, the nuvaring could be a good option if you want to try one day."
5513,"I dont know if theres any consequences for you, but having a prescription for birth control doesnt mean you need to buy it or use it at all."
5514,"Hi, I speak Spanish only so I'm sorry for any mistakes."
5515,I have only one partner.
5516,"So, before putting the implant I have a very high sex drive, now I don't feek attraction for anybody."
5517,"I don't get horny, I don't masturbate anymoreI enjoy sex but it's like a chore, like idk taking a shower, at first you don't want to but when you're in the shower you love it."
5518,My partner doesn't mind (at least that's what he said).
5519,But I do care.
5520,"Also, I take psychiatric medication Wich is rispiridona."

5529,r/Nexplanon is a good sub ) It's not uncommon for women to experience changes in libido on birth control
5530,Ok.. sooo I had taken a pregnancy test on a Monday and it was negative.
5531,Im sure of it!
5532,I went in on the Wednesday of the same week to get my nexplanon and they gave me another pregnancy test and it was negative aswell.
5533,So eventually I got my BC in.
5534,They had called me that same day and I missed their call because I didnt think it was serious.
5535,The next day they called and I picked up and they told me I was pregnant and they redid the test 3 times to make sure of it.
5536,"Now, Im planning to terminate because its not the perfect time."
5537,"I have school to finish and a career to get to so I can provide for a child the best I can in the future because right about now, I cant even take care of myself correctly lol (you know how it is)."
5538,Soo now Im worried.
5539,Im about to be a week with my BC (which is usually when it starts working) and a week of finding out Im pregnant.
5540,Will my implant still work or would I have to go in to get it removed and a new one inserted??!
5541,?
5542,"Yes, your Nexplanon will work to prevent future pregnancy."
5543,It is effective 7 days after insertion.

5559,Hi!
5560,I am 23f and I am getting absolutely fed up with being on HBC.
5561,My body and my mind take a huge hit with it and I have been pondering the idea of paraguard.
5562,"My fianc and I have been together for a long time now but we are not ready for children yet, so I do need some form of BC, but I would love to go nonhormonal."
5563,My SIL keeps telling me to just quit BC all together but I am not comfortable with that idea as I do not want to risk pregnancy.So does anyone have any insight about paraguard?
5564,I have read about the lawsuit against them but most north controls have a lawsuit already.
5565,Please only honest experiences
5566,Have you only tried pills before?
5567,I know personally pills were terrible for me but other methods are fine.
5568,The copper IUDs most common side effects are heavier and more painful periods so I probably wouldnt recommend it if your periods were bad before birth control.
5569,Insertion is probably the worst part about IUDs tbh.
5570,I absolutely loved Paragard until I got pregnant with it in place.
5571,I had my normal period and no side effects.
5572,I checked my strings religiously every time I had sex and they were always the same for over a year.
5573,Honestly I had more success using the pullout method for over five years than I did with Paragard.
5574,"I have paragard and it makes your periods longer, more painful, and heavier."
5575,Im three years in and thats still the case.I went from light periods to very heavy periods that can last up to 10 days.
5576,I also have cramps randomly between periods and cramps during sex.The biggest upside for me is I get to have an extremely effective birth control and an extremely high sex drive at the same time.
5577,"I still ovulate which is a big contributing factor, on a hormonal IUD I would not be ovulating."
5578,There are definitely pros and cons
5579,Ive used paragard for 12 years.
5580,"While it works for my situation if your periods are already difficult, I do not recommend it."

5585,"I have a copper IUD, this is my 2nd one, so its been 7 years I think since I got my first one."
5586,I love it!
5587,"Struggled a bit with cramping and spotting when I first got it, but after the first year I have had little to no issues."
5588,I think maybe my periods got a little bit more intense (maybe by like 1015 worse?)
5589,"but I had a very light flow to begin with.I dont think the brand I have is Paragard because I live in Canada, I think its Mona Lisa or something?"
5590,But overall I have loved it!
5591,HBC pills messed me up and I have never been good at consistency.
5592,Happy not to be putting extra hormones in my body and to not have to worry about getting pregnant.
5593,It gave me such horrible heavy periods.
5594,I just bought an Oura ring to track my cycles so I can do natural family planning.
5595,Im married and not trying to have children at this point but I feel comfortable enough to try this method instead of HBC.
5596,Do you have paraguard or a different IUD?
5597,"Aw that sucks, your iud must have been inserted incorrectly or moved"
5598,"Actually, since hormonal iuds only use progesterone, they only affect ovulation like, half the time."
5599,They mostly work by thinning the uterine lining and thickening the cervix
5600,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge."
5601,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge."
5602,"I have a hormonal IUD, the Mirena."
5603,"I love it honestly, no period and besides bloating at the beginning it hasnt affected me in any noticeable way."
5604,I was offered a Paraguard but didnt take it because I originally started hormonal bc because of monster periods.
5605,It was checked with ultrasound and was correct.
5606,"It may have moved ever so slightly, but my strings felt the same as always and midwife said everything was normal and that they see ""a lot"" of Paragard pregnancies."
5607,"Ohhhhh no way, even more reason for me to switch"
5608,Paragard pregnancies are extremely rare.
5609,Its more than 99 effective.
5610,Its more at risk of MOVING than other birth controls though.
5611,The cramping could still happen for you during sex or outside of your period.
5612,"Unfortunately that's just a side effect of IUDs, but my period is very light now, even after having my hormonal IUD for a year."
5613,So if you want to switch I would recommend the liletta or Mirena.
5614,"Liletta is just the generic of Mirena, they are exactly the same."
5615,"It's 99.2 for the first year (97.8 cumulative over 12 years), that's still 8 out of 1,000 using it that first year having a failure."
5616,"It's rare, but it does happen."
5617,"Sometimes birth control fails, even if everything seems correct, this is why we always say nothing is 100."
5618,Shouldn't the moving be factored in?
5619,There's no way to tell and there's nothing you can do about it.
5620,Hello everyone.
5621,So my boyfriend and I had unprotected sex this morning/ last night.
5622,It wouldve been the 3rd or 4th day of my period.
5623,He came in me I would say about two times.
5624,Since then I have still been bleeding due to my period.
5625,Im paranoid because Im debating weather or not I should take a plan b.
5626,But I heard that it is really hard to get pregnant on your period.
5627,Also my cycles are irregular and I have pcos and my periods last about 34 days.
5628,"Anyway, should I take the plan b?"
5629,You can get pregnant from sex on your period.
5630,"If youre not wanting to get pregnant, take the plan b and use protection next time regardless of where you are in your cycle."

5656,Have you had mental health issues related to using the copper IUD?
5657,"Recently realized that I've had significant mental health stuff since I had the copper IUD inserted nearly 7 or 8 years ago, the past year or two Ive had the distinct feeling that something isnt right with my hormones Ive been having horrible breakouts for the past year, I get SO incredibly sad and teary the week prior to my period, spot for days leading up my period and then bleed often heavily for anywhere from 57 days sometimes it feels like I get only two weeks out of the month where I feel normal."
5658,"In retrospect I can see that struggling more with my mental health and when I got the IUD are somewhat correlated ugh I was reluctant to go on hormonal BC, which is why I went the nonhormonal route in the first place and now Im wondering if my mental health has been affected by the paraguard??"
5659,One of the most chilling symptoms that can come with using the Paraguard I undoubtably experienced was OCD/Relationship OCD that was crippling and nearly ended my relationship.
5660,Im just wanting to know about other peoples experiences.
5661,"I live overall a healthy lifestyle, have read so many books on regulating hormones, talked to herbalists etc."
5662,which is part of the reason why its been mysterious to me why I am still so fucking MOODY.
5663,Please please comment or DM me if you or someone u know has experienced anything similar x200B
5664,"Its likely not due to the Paraguard, its non hormonal and didnt develop till you were on it for years."
5665,"It is worth talking to a doctor though, if its around your cycle you may have pmdd."
5666,I had it before hormonal birth control and totally relate to the feeling of only having two okay weeks a month.

5671,Nonhormonal doesn't mean it can't possibly affect hormones.
5672,I can't wait for this myth to finally go away.
5673,My copper IUD gave me the worst acne of my life.
5674,I also had PMDD because of my copper IUD.
5675,It's a shame that gynecologist don't read the memo.
5676,"I'm sure this question has been asked a thousand times already but I'm getting my IUD put in tomorrow morning and I'm pretty nervous so I'm just looking for a bit of comfort.I've seen many people saying the process of getting it put in was one of the most painful experiences of their lives and it made me really scared so I'd appreciate any tips on how to make it hurt less (I don't care about the cramps, just the moment of having it put in).My doctor gave me Misofar to help loosen up the cervix and said he'd give me diazepam and ibuprofen (advil) before the procedure as well but I'm worried it won't be enough to make the pain manageable, even the thought of it makes me nauseous."
5677,I'm not on my period because mine are too irregular to schedule an appointment at the correct time so I'm thinking of taking some stronger (hydrocodone) painkillers that I have lying around in my cabinet to lessen the pain.
5678,Is it a bad idea?
5679,Is there anything else I can do to make it hurt less?
5680,"Hi ,i got my iud a week ago and youre lucky that your doctor gave you misofar, diazepam and ibuprofen i only had ibuprofen and it was hell not to scare you but i suggest to try breathing techniques and maybe take a stress ball with you and about hydrocodone maybe you should ask your doctor dont take strong pain killers like that"

5685,"Just got mine inserted today, actually!I'm prescribed hydrocodone and it has not helped with the pain."
5686,"That could be because I have a fatty liver, though, so don't take that too far to heart."
5687,"If you have had severe cramps, it's sort of the same thing."
5688,"I was fortunate enough to have been dealing with severe cramps the days leading up to it, so the pain wasn't as jarring as it would have been if I had never had it before."
5689,"They will describe it as a pinch and two cramps, most likely."
5690,"The pinch is really hard to describe, but it is a sharp ish pain."
5691,"The ""cramps"" will hurt much worse than that, and if you have never had it before, it may genuinely feel like you are being stabbed."
5692,"From what I have read, Ibuprofen doesn't really help at all, and I took it before I got mine inserted."
5693,Some places will sedate you on request.
5694,"My gynecologist didn't warn me before the ""pinch,"" and honestly, I'm pretty grateful because the surprise ended up overriding the pain."
5695,Do expect to be lightheaded afterward.
5696,They let me lie there for a while.
5697,"So far, the pain 7 hours later is describable as shards of glass and cramping."
5698,"Moving positions is sometimes a bit painful.I got my IUD inserted the same day it was suggested to me by my gynecologist and I feel like I wish I had known all of this before I did it, but I chose to just get it over with due to some symptoms I had been having."
5699,"I got mine inserted a few months ago and prior to my insertion I was also really nervous and prepared for the worst pain of my life, and it ended up being mildly uncomfortable."
5700,"I got lucky and happened to get my period the day before my appointment, so I can't speak to what it's like while not on your period but I'll tell you my experience."
5701,"My doctor said I would feel 3 cramps, the first was the tenaculum gripping the cervix to hold it in place."
5702,Usually people describe it as a pinch or a sharp pain.
5703,I barely felt it.
5704,"Like, if my doctor didn't tell me it was happening I probably wouldn't have even noticed."
5705,The first actual cramp was when she measured my uterus.
5706,"That one felt like a moderate period cramp, it hurt but it was very bearable and lasted about 30 seconds."
5707,The other cramp was when the IUD was actually inserted and that one hurt about the same as the other one (maybe a bit less) and again only lasted 30 seconds.
5708,"I was able to get up and drive home immediately after insertion.I would definitely recommend taking painkillers, I think I took about 1000mg of ibuprofen a couple hours before."
5709,"I don't know for sure how much it actually helps, but at the very least it was comforting to have taken something even if it's basically a placebo."
5710,"Also, really focus on your breathing during the insertion."
5711,"I know it's cliche to say ""just breathe"" but it seriously helps."
5712,"Try not to think about the pain, just breathe deeply (4 sec per inhale, 4 sec per exhale) and repeat the words ""in and out"" in your head."
5713,"Also, unrelated to pain, but make sure you drink a lot of liquid in the hours leading up to the appointment."
5714,They'll probably have you pee in a cup and that part was honestly the hardest part of the whole appointment for me lol.This was long but I just want to reiterate that the horror stories you read on the internet are not everyone's experience.
5715,Often times the loudest voices are the most extreme and the people with average experiences aren't posting about it.
5716,"It's possible that you'll have a painful insertion, everyone's body reacts differently, but know that even if that's the case, the whole process lasts less than 3 minutes, and there's also a good chance you'll have a very boring, normal insertion.Good luck!"
5717,I didn't get any medication when I got mine put in and it didn't hurt at all.
5718,Not sure why.
5719,Just one small cramp and it was over
5720,The cramp was pretty bad during insertion.
5721,"However, it was over after 15 seconds."
5722,Don't be too nervous.
5723,"Got mine a month ago, took a Xanax and some Ibuprofen and the pain was not bad."
5724,Felt like a sharper more intense period cramp but it was totally over in 20 seconds!
5725,Have someone drive you if you plan on taking anything stronger than advil.
5726,"Wear sweats, have a heating pad at home"
5727,Do not go  Trust me  wait until you are on your period.
5728,It makes sooo much difference.
5729,"During your period, your cervix is dilated and insertion is easy... off your period it hurts like hell."
5730,I have gotten insertions during both and I would never go unless I was bleeding.
5731,"So fucking lucky, you don't even get a Paracetamol offered in the UK."
5732,"I'm in the same boat rn hahahah I'm in pain trying to distract myself by replying to all the reddit comments but honestly I've had horrible period cramps ever since I got my first period and the insertion was just like my cramping on bad days so it wasn't super scary,,,, the cramps rn go crazy though hoping it'll be over by tomorrow"
5733,"I do apologize if that did not answer your question, currently also puzzled on how to mitigate the pain but wanted to be of some aid."
5734,Yeah definitely!
5735,"The anxiety the days before was absolutely the worse part, the actual insertion didn't hurt too badly and the doctors were very nice and reassuring."
5736,"The one who did the insertion was an old guy with a lot of experience with IUDs and the other two doctors were holding my hand and distracting me because I told them I had really bad anxiety, so it ended up just feeling like a regular period cramp."
5737,"It also helps that they didn't try to lie to me and say it wouldn't hurt, but instead explained in the nicest way possible that going in with as little anxiety as possible would make it hurt less.All in all, the insertion was not the big deal I'd made it out to be in my mind, and the cramps in the following hours, which were the part that worried me the least are KILLING me right now I don't think I've had cramps this bad since my first period (which I almost was hospitalized for because my family thought I had my appendix burst because of how much pain I was in) and I'm posting replies on reddit to take my mind off it because shit it's rough rn but it's not unbearable, just very uncomfortableSorry for the long rant I'm just trying to distract myself and high on painkillers but to anyone out there that is anxious about an IUD insertion, it doesn't have to be scary, and if you're nervous DEFINITELY do ask for a diazepam if they refuse to give you anything stronger than advil because even though it's not a painkiller it helps with the anxiety, which is what could make the insertion painful"
5738,"Thank you for posting this, half of these stories are scaring the absolute shit out of me, but I have had a terribly painful miscarriage and I was wondering if the pain of that inserted iud would even compare to that.."
5739,"The opposite happened for me lmao insertion was alright it was just like a mild period pain but right now I'm incapacitated in bed because I'm having the worst cramps I've ever had in my life, hoping it'll be over soon"
5740,"Heating pad coming in clutch but I can barely stand up to go reheat it when it gets lukewarm, turns out I was worried about the wrong part of the process because the aftermath definitely hurts way worse for me"
5741,"Eh, the insertion wasn't extremely bad I'd say (maybe because they gave me diazepam and I took a small dose of vicodin beforehand), just felt like a more painful than average period cramp, having the time of my life rn in bed though cuz the cramps are so bad they're like what I thought the insertion would be like I can barely sit or move at all"
5742,"It's definitely better 2 days after, today it's only a little bit of pain."
5743, I'm sorry OP.
5744,Hope it's over soon

5803,Hello!
5804,I got my Kyleena in Nov. 2020 and I truly feel it has damaged my body.
5805,"I have gained weight, have nonstop cramping, pain during intercourse, and the most sporadic and inconsistent periods (before my period was very normal).My most recent period has been going on for 14 days and my stomach is swollen."
5806,My gyno has scanned me multiple times and the IUD is always in its correct place.I am considering removing it.Have any of you had similar experiences?

5811,Hi!
5812,I just got the kyleena IUD and Im planning to go on a week long trip with my boyfriend next month.
5813,"If my cycle is somewhat regular, I will probably be on my period by then."
5814,I have read many stories in which people say that their first period after getting kyleena was extremely painful and overall I just wouldnt like being on my period during the trip.
5815,Would it be possible to combine the kyleena with my hormone birth control pill (which I used for over 5 years before getting kyleena) for that week to make sure I wont get my period?
5816,Or will this be considered a hormone overdose and/or could it be dangerous?
5817,Does anyone have any experience with this?

5828,It's just that im bleeding down there.
5829,I put the patch on my right upper thigh right below the hips.

5849,is it okay for me to take my friends birth control?
5850,"I wouldnt recommend that, you can get a prescription through SimpleHealth or Nurx and there is a way to prevent your parents from seeing you were prescribed birth control on your insurance."
5851,There are some pills that have a 0 copay with insurance.
5852,"As you are a minor, I would be very wary of doing that if you are not able to take yourself to the doctor and explain to them what is going on if you have side effects without facing repercussions from your parents."

5860,Birth control pills are a standard dose though.
5861,As someone who is heavier I had to put that in there because I had to have a higher dose.
5862,I have been on the combo pill since I was 17 and I'm 20 now (3 years).
5863,I have been using the same brand of pill for a little over a year and a half now and have never missed a pill.
5864,About 2 hours ago my stomach started cramping pretty badly so I went lay down.
5865,About 20 minuites ago I got up and went to the bathroom.
5866,The following is a little TMI so be warned.
5867,It felt like I was starting my period and I wanted to check so I washed my hands and inserted my finger to see if I was bleeding.
5868,"When I removed it, I found that I WAS bleeding.I have 3 days until I start taking my placebo pills and I have not missed a pill or taken a pill late this month."
5869,I always take them at 10pm sharp and I am VERY anal about taking my pills on time.
5870,I'm just wondering if I should be concerned with staring my withdrawal bleed early.
5871,I typically start bleeding 2 or 3 days into the placebo pills.
5872,This has never happened to me and I'm concerned I might be at risk for pregnancy.
5873,"I know you bleed on the placebo week because of the drop in hormones so I dont know why I'm bleeding now or if this is even ""normal."
5874,"""Any help/advice is appreciated!"
5875,If you have never missed a pill you are protected from pregnancy.Sometimes things like irregular bleeding or spotting can happen any time during the pill pack.
5876,Its a normal thing that can happen.
5877,"It does not mean that your protection is compromised.If youre concerned just take a test 14 days after last sex with the first morning pee or 4hr hold, or 21 days after where you dont gotta do that.Since you take your pills at the exact time everyday you are very protected."
5878,Chances are its just hormones being hormones and sometimes hormones are dicks.

5885,What should I do in preparation for this?
5886,"My doctor does not offer any kind of pain management, she says I should take an ibuprofen beforehand."

5892,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
5893,I would suggest taking 800mg of ibuprofen (same thing as Advil) about an hour beforehand.
5894,Take both ibruprofen and paracetamol before hand.
5895,Just had mine in today.
5896,I wouldnt say I was in pain but I fully recommend you either get taken by someone to your appointment or use a taxi.
5897,I had to wait about an hour after insertion to leave due to feeling faint so couldnt drive.
5898,Did not expect that and it made leaving a hassle when all I wanted was to be home lying down with a hot water bottle.
5899,Been 7 hours since I had it done and the cramping has eased.
5900,Absolute best to you!
5901,Hello!
5902,I had the kyleena iud placed August 1st of 2022 (over 1 year ago).
5903,"My periods were normal for awhile, but the last 4 or so months I have noticed irregular periods."
5904,"For example, I will get it the second week of one month but the third or last week of the following month."
5905,"I asked my GYN and she did not seem concerned, but I just wanted to check here and see if anyone has had similar issues or if this seems like a red flag of some sort."

5910,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
5911,How likely is it to get pregnant from perfect condom use?
5912,Long post explaining my weird situation.
5913,"TW mention of ed, sh, saI 24f am diagnosed with autism."
5914,I've never seen a gyn.
5915,Doctors make me go nonverbal and meltdown.
5916,"Every time I see a Dr without an advocate, they try to send me to the psych er, and have succeeded before."
5917,I no longer go to any appointments alone but I still melt down every time.
5918,I have a history of sexual assault and medical trauma.
5919,I'm in the asexual spectrum.
5920,I want to want sex but it's painful and I panic every time.
5921,I have no sex drive but I want to.
5922,"Unfortunately, my fear of pregnancy is also a big deterrent to being sexually active."
5923,I was prescribed the nuvaring last year before my wedding.
5924,"By the time I was married, I was so suicidal I couldn't function."
5925,"I didn't recognize my partner, I became insane."
5926,I wound up cutting my chest all over without it registering what I was doingI felt like a zombie.
5927,My husband begged me to get off the bc.
5928,It took a few months to feel normal again so now I'm absolutely terrified to go back on it.
5929,"I'm actively bulimic so I don't regularly menstruate, so I can't track my fertile cycle."
5930,It also makes taking oral pills difficult as a lot of what I consume winds up being thrown up.
5931,I want to try sex with my husband again.
5932,We haven't tried in 8 months.
5933,I don't think I can emotionally handle birth control but I'd rather be dead than pregnant.
5934,How can I have safe sex and not get pregnant without hormonal bc?
5935,I feel so useless and defeated.
5936,I want to be normal so badly.
5937,I don't know what to do.
5938,I don't currently have a gp because my last 2 wanted me in rehab for bulimia and I was afraid they'd commit me again.
5939,Birth control is the least of which you should be worrying about right now.
5940,This is absolutely no way to live and it wont get better unless something changes.
5941,My heart breaks for you after reading this.
5942,Let yourself be helped.
5943,Sorry youre going through all that ( I just use condoms with my partner and we havent had a single scare!
5944,"Just make sure they fit your partner correctly and arent too loose or too tight, are not expired, and that you use waterbased lubricant so that the condom doesnt break."
5945,If you ask your partner to pull out as well when theyre wearing a condom that might help ease your mind!
5946,Theres virtually no risk of pregnancy with condom  pullout.
5947,"I have been there, my ex was mentally, physically, and sexually abusive."
5948,I also had vaginismus when it comes to my current spouse.
5949,But knowing he wouldnt hurt me and him giving me the okay to control how the bedroom went helped me a lot personally.
5950,"However while it is unfortunate to say, sometimes you do have to rip the bandaid off to get the mental help you need."
5951,"While being admitted isnt the greatest option, it helped me, and my friends."
5952,And I am a huge advocate of mental help.
5953,And sometimes you cant do things on your own.
5954,It doesnt help everyone I know and I might be downvoted for even saying that.
5955,"But I think first things first before you do anything is to get the mental help you need, you can put a bandaid on by using only condoms, but your vaginismus will still be a thing and your suicidal tendencies, and your bulimia will still be a thing."
5956,Mental health can be a long grueling process sometimes but at the end of it if you have the right person you will be very appreciative of it.
5957,But you need to have help sometimes to get past the past traumas.
5958,Not everyone can do it without professional help and thats okay!
5959,Sometimes we need that little extra boost to get better.
5960,I also used condoms for years and never had any issues when it comes to pregnancies.
5961,"And then I switched to the pill with my current spouse.But as one abuse victim to another, while it does hurt to say, please get the mental help you need."
5962,There are online therapy sessions you can do as well if need be.

5968,I want to be able to have sex like everyone else
5969,Thank you
5970,Thank you!
5971,Thank you xx it's nice to hear about your using only condoms.
5972,"I have had a lot of help, but right now I can't access help unfortunately."
5973,It's a complicated issue
5974,"Believe me, Ive been down that route, I understand."
5975,Sometimes its hard to get back on your feet and find another therapist or anything like that.
5976,"However when you have the time to do that, I feel like it is priority number 1."
5977,Because things like eating disorders and suicidal thoughts cant be left on their own.
5978,"The best I can say in the meantime is make sure you have a support system, it could be a mix of family and friends but make sure they are there to help you on the path of recovery.Make sure they actively want to help you in any means necessary."
5979,And make sure you dont have any enablers in that group.
5980,None that make it easy for you to continue down the spiraling path.
5981,"While my advice might not work for everyone, it helped me to have people who cared and actively wanted me to get better Because with the bulimia involved this isnt just a mental health issues, its a health issue."
5982,And I want you to be able to get better
5983,I can't get outpatient help due to the severity of my ed.
5984,I've been turned down from the last dozen therapists I reached out to.
5985,It's extremely disheartening to be told I'm too sick and unable to be given help due to liability.
5986,"I'm not suicidal, but on birth control I felt very suicidal, hence my fear about going on it again."
5987,"Thank you for your compassionate response, I really appreciate it."
5988,Then you are in the bad bad danger zone.
5989,When that happens its like the therapist feels like their hands are tied and it is out of their hands.
5990,"They arent denying you help, I read your post history and there seems to be misunderstandings.You arent being cast aside, but the severity of your condition is what is being focused on."
5991,"You are being given help, but it just isnt the easy help you want."
5992,"And while inpatient facilities can be a pain in the ass, at the end of the day the therapists you have seen have all determined your condition is too severe."
5993,So in this case its either that or have complications later.
5994,"Its not the information you want, and the fear of the unknown of what will happen is probably controlling you the most when it comes to it, however think of things like a goal."
5995,"And lets say your goal is I want to get better to be with my husband for the rest of our lives, focus on that goal."
5996,"However at the end of the day the decision is up to you, and things are always baby steps, it isnt a huge change overnight when it comes to anything mental health related."
5997,Just good luck and hopefully you can figure out what you can do to get the help you need
5998,Also support groups might be a way to go instead if needed
5999,It doesn't feel like bad bad danger zone.
6000,"I haven't fainted in 2 weeks and I don't purge as bad as I used to, it was like 5 times a day every day,  now it's like 25x so I FEEL ok."
6001,I think.
6002,I just want a sex drive and to be normal in some aspect of my life.
6003,"Depending on the time from when you were told that to now, if you are actively trying your best to improve yourself, then you might be able to do outpatient help."
6004,"But its a lot of work and willpower, but if youre actively trying to get better, and not lying to yourself to make things seem like they arent as bad as they actually are then constant improvements you should be able to.However keep focused on your goal."
6005,"Maybe have someone supervise you eating, I know parents have to do that sometimes when their kids have it."
6006,Like its a long process but healing is possible.
6007,"However, while you may feel okay, you might not actually be okay, and thats the connection that you have to make."
6008,"Because you can say I dont think its that bad but everyone and their brother is saying otherwise, maybe everyone and their brother has a point."
6009,"Im not downplaying, Ive been there where I thought I wasnt in as bad of a situation."
6010,But the reality of it was I was in a horrible situation.
6011,Thank you.
6012,I was turned down last month.
6013,"Extreme bulimia is 14x a week, I'm hitting 2530x a week which seems like very little to me in comparison to my past but a lot clinically."
6014,It's a lot.
6015,"I don't think I can stop, I'm 11 years into this and I've done rehab and stuff but idk."
6016,"Yeah, thats the reason why."
6017,And the first step is being honest with yourself and then getting the help you genuinely need.
6018,And sticking with the plans for help.
6019,I have no control of it.
6020,I could control sex but idk.
6021,I am just drifting through life.
6022,I'm so afraid of pregnancy but I want to be a good wife.
6023,Especially because I feel like I'm dying all the time.
6024,I want to be good to him while I'm alive.
6025,"So for context, Im 26 and got my Kyleena inserted April 29th of this year."
6026,Insertion went well and was virtually painless (to my surprise).
6027,I had some cramping for 2 days afterwards but nothing unmanageable.
6028,Fast forward to now.. Im still getting my period (which I dont mind) and its quite regular but for some reason the cramps are SO much worse and more sharp than I normally have.
6029,My periods when not on BC typically come with cramping but nothing that cant be controlled with some Advil.
6030,These cramps are next level and start a few days before I get my period and last for almost the entire duration.
6031,I got the position of my IUD checked and it looks good and the strings havent moved as far as I can tell.
6032,Has anyone else experienced this as well?
6033,And if you did how long did it take to stop (if ever)?
6034,Yes!!!
6035,"My cramps have gotten way worse, some months are worse than others."
6036,I just take a lot of aleve!

6052,okay sounds good im just a little stressed about a situation!
6053,Hi friends so Ive been experiencing quite a bit of weight loss after starting the xulane patch in April.
6054,"I (21 F) weighed 139 when I started the patch, and Ive noticed a lack of appetite."
6055,"Despite this lack of appetite, Ive still been eating."
6056,I now weigh 122.
6057,I guess Im just nervous because this is quite a bit of weight in a short amount of time without any real changes to my diet and without working out.
6058,"I still eat 3 meals a day, I just snack a little less."
6059,"Truly just snack a little less, no other diet alterations."
6060,"I know most people dont complain about losing weight, but 1517 pounds in the span of 5 or so months without any real change is a bit concerning."
6061,Im also 52 so weight looks a bit different on me as I am a smaller person if you will.
6062,"I was on the xulane patch for two months when I was 16, and I went from 124 to 118."
6063,"I know I should speak to a doctor but my OBGYN/GYNO cant see me until January, and my primary care cant see me until December Did anybody else LOSE weight or lose their appetite when starting hormonal birth control?"
6064,Any advice on how to combat this?
6065,"I dont want to gain it all back necessarily, but I dont want to keep losing either I feel like this isnt healthy."

6072,"I was in long relationships for years, I am 24 years old and started taking birth control pills when I was 17."
6073,"Last year we broke up with my bf, and I was really happy about not having sex and not thinking about birth control methods."
6074,"When the hormones from bc got out of my body, I started seeing men differently tho lol."
6075,"My libido is very high, and I am in a sex relationship with a guy."
6076,"Its really passionate and spontanious so sometimes we dont think about condoms and we use the pull out method, which I know is verrry very risky."
6077,"He is okay with putting on condom, but I can see and feel it that it kills him a little bit."
6078,"I never had any problems with the pill, my libido was okay, but I am so happy about having it high and finding so much more happiness in men and sex."
6079,"What do you think, which method would suite me/us the best?"
6080,"I was thinking about natural cyclesdiaphragmpull out, but I dont see how this could be carefree."
6081,Getting back on the pill would be the best idea?
6082,"I am not having that much sex, 1, maximum 2 times a week."
6083,Please use condoms.
6084,STIs are also a thing.
6085,Pullout or natural cycles arent reliable methods and theres a high likelihood that youll eventually end up pregnant.
6086,If a man has issues with putting on a condom please dont see him anymore.

6128,Hey guys I am a 20yo M and Ive always been paranoid with pregnancy just because my parents had me when they were young so its been such a big deal for me .
6129,My partner is on Nexplanon and I have been doing research about birth control and have read a lot of posts .
6130,I was wondering if it is safe to ejaculate inside while she has the Nexplanon ?
6131,"Help me out here, Im just trying to calm my paranoia down !"
6132,"Yes, its safe."
6133,"Birth control is designed and tested with the intent that its the only form of birth control being used (no condoms, no withdrawal)."

6139,I recently started taking the pill about a month ago which caused spotting for about a week.
6140,I went to a new gyno and got the depo shot while I was still spotting (she wouldnt prescribe me the pill again for medical issues).
6141,"I know the depo shot works right away if youre on your period, but since I was only spotting idk if I should take a plan b or not since I only got it a few days ago."
6142,Any advice?

6151,Me and my girlfriend had sex last Saturday morning.
6152,She was on her 5th day period.
6153,We didn't use any protection.
6154,During intercourse I might have ejaculated inside her (maybe few drops but not sure) then pulled it out.
6155,Should I be worried?
6156,Or what are the chances of getting her pregnant?
6157,She should consider emergency contraception asap if youre trying to avoid pregnancy.
6158,Plan B should be taken within 3 days OR EllaOne within 5.
6159,Do not take both.
6160,Theres a max 30 chance of pregnancy per cycle.

6166,I just need some reassurance that everything will be ok no matter what but my life feels like it's about to get turned upside down.
6167,My bf and I had sex a few times right around when I was supposedly ovulating according to the app.
6168,(Dumb I know but here we are.)
6169,"We're always super safe with condoms, putting it on the whole time, pulling out and gripping the base, even testing it with water afterwards."
6170,"And yet now I'm four days late and having a few random ""pregnancy symptoms"" that are most likely part of my panic disorder."
6171,(Also not on BC bc of how painful it made my periods in the past.
6172,)My panic disorder caused me to ask my principal at the Christian school I teach at if pregnancy out of wedlock gets you fired and she said yes.
6173,I can't even believe this isn't illegal for a religious organization.My family is also very Christian and will freak the fuck out.
6174,I've spent the last week crying and having multiple panic attacks and trying to continue to teach through it all and this week will likely be the same till I can take a test (week after missed period mark).I know I messed up but at the same time..am trying to work through it and stay positive and I will be going to therapy soon for the panics and emetophobia.
6175,Any kind words or similar experiences appreciated.
6176,"If you used a condom correctly and even tested with water afterwards, you arent pregnant."
6177,Dont panic before you get a positive.
6178,Take a deep breath!
6179,You dont even know if you are pregnant yet.
6180,"You may try taking a test with urine from the first pee of the day, if youre already having symptoms a test may come back positive prior to a week after your period."

6182,"Further, just because you could be fired doesnt mean that they would actually fire you."

6188,"31 female here, I have been on the depo for five years and Im getting married in October."
6189,I am DEATHLY afraid of getting pregnant.
6190,Its always been a fear.Today I  was having a conversation with my mother about my Soon To Be and my concerns.
6191,(We havent had sex yet) she told me I was really shy for basically even thinking about condoms on my wedding night.
6192,I mean I know its not cool but I did lay it all on the table the first night He and I met.
6193,And told him it was a fear plus neither one of us wants children.
6194,Can anyone console me?
6195,Googles numbers arent that great on odds.
6196,And everything in my mind says theres always a chance of pregnancy.
6197,"If you want him to wear condoms, have him wear one."
6198,"This is a decision between you and your fianc, not your mother."
6199,Depo is over 99 effective over an entire year.
6200,You are very well protected by it alone.
6201,"Like I said though, YOUR comfort is what matters."
6202,Its YOUR body and she has no right to make you feel bad about how you decide to protect yourself.
6203,"youd be the the one that would be carrying and barring this child and then taking care of them for the rest of ur life, screw what ur MIL thinks as long as ur fianc is understanding then ur doing the right thing."
6204,"If you're sure you never want kids, talk to your fiance and get your tubes tied.But, I gotta say, this sounds more like an anxiety issue than anything."
6205,"If your anxiety has kept you from having sex with your fiance at 31 years old, even tho you're on depo, that's a severe issue.Also, keep in mind that the stats for bc methods are like...if its 99, that means if 100 women use JUST that method while fucking for a whole year, only one would get pregnant."
6206,It doesn't mean you have a 1/100 chance of getting pregnant.
6207,if he uses a condom then youre even more protected.

6224,Definitely not a Virgin though so.
6225,I get it.
6226,All of what you are saying.
6227,I mean I suppose I could pack a plan B and cross my fingers.
6228,Make my mom go with me if I have to have an abor
6229,There will be alcohol so hopefully that helps the anxiety attack.
6230,"Like I said, if you want him to wear one, have him wear one."
6231,Any man worth your time will never complain about wearing a condom for your peace of mind.
6232,Im personally on Nexplanon and still make my partner wear one 95 of the time.
6233,"If youve talked to your fianc about it and hes fine with it, then just use one."
6234,"I should have said bilateral salpingectomy  nowadays they fully remove the fallopian tubes, making it more effective than prior surgeries where they'd just ligate them.But yeah, if it makes you feel better, have a plan and emergency fund for if things go wrong."
6235,I find that letting my fears stay vague is terrible for my anxiety.
6236,I have pregnancy fear too.
6237,"I've thought about what I would do, and that does help."
6238,x200BI agree with everyone else though that it's not at all unreasonable to make your husband wear a condom.
6239,"As long as you're communicating with him, it should be fine."
6240,"I will warn you though, a lot of men don't take it seriously when women say they don't want kids."
6241,They assume they'll change their mind and get upset when they realize that kids truly aren't in the picture.
6242,Okay.
6243,Thank you for the encouragement
6244,I have been on Nextstellis for over a year now with no issues.
6245,But back in May I had a surgery to remove an ovarian cyst which resulted in the need to remove my left fallopian tube and part of my left ovary.
6246,Every month since then I have had horrible periods along with spotting that starts about a week after my period ends up until it starts again.
6247,My Dr thinks there is no cause for concern but I am just fed up with it.
6248,I want to stay on birth control because I dont want any kids at the moment and being on birth control is the best way to preserve my remaining ovary and tube (no ovulation) Has anyone been through this?
6249,Idk if continuing or stopping is the best choice at this point

6256,The combo pill has a 12 hour window.
6257,The POP has a 3 hour one.
6258,Regardless you are fine and do not need a Plan B.

6276,"I hope you get a response soon, as thats really something they should be telling people."
6277,Talk to a pharmacist.
6278,They will know way more about the medication than your doctor will.
6279,"My partner and I have started using the desogrestrel 75mg pill as a contraceptive lately and are a bit confused, the patient information leaflet inside the packaging says nothing about starting the pill after the first 5 period days and other information conflicts, every other source including the nhs says youre protected after 2 days but the leaflet says 7?"
6280,"Nhs does say this is because ovulation is stopped after 7 days while thickening the cervix takes 2 but Im not too sure about thisSome clarification would be much appreciated, thanks"
6281,I've always read to use backup for 7 days with the desogestrel pill if you don't start on the first day of your period.
6282,"This is likely because stopping ovulation is the primary way this pill works, with thickening mucus and such being secondary."
6283,"I know with the strict 3 hour pills (like norethindrone) the changes to mucus wear off quickly after 24 hours, so maybe that is true with desogestrel too and it would be complicated to explain the nuances without confusing people (as a missed pill would be after just 3 hours instead of the usual 12 hours before day 7)."
6284,"I am not sure though, just a guess on my part.From the Cerazette pamphlet(  On the first day of your period take the first Cerazette tablet."
6285,Additional contraceptive precautions are not necessary.
6286,"If you take your first tablet on days 25 of your period use an additional barrier method of contraception for the first 7 days of tablettaking.From the Cerelle pamphlet( You may also start on days 25 of your cycle, but in that casemake sure you also use an additional contraceptive method(barrier method) for the first 7 days of tablettaking.Edit I do see what you mean though about the pamphlet not saying anything about starting after day 5."

6329,For a while Ive been wanting to get off of the pill as Ive lived my entire puberty/postpuberty life on it (Im now 20.)

6336,It's a false premise that natural  better.

6339,Usually my pharmacist faxes my doctor a request for a new prescription and I don't need to go back for an appointment.As far as other options  the hormonal IUD can also help with periods.
6340,"Due to how it's designed, way less of the hormone ends up in your bloodstream compared to the pill."
6341,I also got on BC at around 14 due to heavy and irregular periods.
6342,When I was 20 I stopped BC for a year and my period was pretty mild and regular.
6343,You could try to come off BC for a while to get to know your cycle again.
6344,Then you can go from there.
6345,"If you like the way you feel and your periods are manageable, perhaps you can look into nonhormonal contraception like the copper IUD."
6346,"If your periods are still quite heavy, you can look into hormonal BC options again (pill, nuvaring, IUD, patch, etc..)."

6353,I completely understand that but I havent had the chance to know if my natural cycle would be any of those things.
6354,"Sure, you could try going off the pill.for a while and see what happens."

6419,So is it worth taking a 2 month break?

6421,Or would it be unnecessary disruption to my cycle to go off then back on again in a few months?

6423,Not worth it.
6424,"You wont see much, if any, benefit."
6425,Youll restart your adjustment period which can increase side effects.
6426,Its not recommended to start and stop the pill as your risk of blood clots is highest when first starting.

6476,I was expecting the first couple of weeks to be complete hormonal chaos as I am very sensitive to hormonal changes and experience my PMDD symptoms for around 3 out of 4 weeks in a cycle.

6482,Did it last if so?

6509,Hey everyone.
6510,I'm from California and I have MediCal which is California's version of the Medicaid program for lowincome individuals.I've been using The Pill Club for the past 2 years.
6511,It was very convenient as they would send me a whole year's worth of pills and MediCal covered it all.
6512,I paid 0.
6513,Recently they shut down.
6514,Does anyone know if there's an alternative supplier to The Pill Club that will not cost me?
6515,I've heard of several sites but it seems like they charge for a consultation fee even if the pills are covered and/or their shipping is known to be unreliable.
6516,I'm tight on money right now so I'm not sure if I'll be able to afford any doctor consultation fees if MediCal does not cover it.
6517,I don't mind the pills being shipped or picked up.
6518,I'm on my last 2 packs and I'm panicking a little bit.Thank you!
6519,Go to your regular doctor.
6520,Send the RX to CVS  they can ship it to you

6532,my boyfriend and i have sex very often and each time he usually finishes in me.
6533,i take the pill.
6534,ive had friends say that their boyfriends have finished in them all the time while theyre on the pill and have had no pregnancy scares but ive just been paranoid recently that im interpreting my friends advice wrong and the pill actually wont protect me from being finished in.
6535,can i be finished in every time?
6536,or should he pull out and the birth control be used as an emergency if i get it inside me?
6537,?
6538,"Th pill is designed to be used that way, so consider its advertised statistics accordingly."
6539,"Every method has a failure rate, so using an additional barrier method as backup is a great idea."
6540,"Whatever you do, do not use the pill only in emergency situations (not sure if I understand the end part you wrote correctly)."
6541,"If the active pills are not taken as prescribed, then it is not going to be effective."
6542,The pill is over 99 effective with perfect use.
6543,"That means taking it at the same time every single day, never being late, storing the pills correctly, not taking any medication that would interact with it, and knowing that its efficacy would be reduced if you threw up/ had diarrhoea."
6544,"Its a personal choice if you want to let him finish in you, if youre comfortable with the statistics then theres no problem."
6545,"If youre nervous about it, either have him pull out or use a condom, but as the other commenter said, do not only use the pill as emergency contraception."
6546,It can only protect you if its taken properly.
6547,"Its up to your general comfort level, I let mine and Im also on the pill."
6548,"They arent placebo pills, and while yes they arent 100 effective they are pretty close enough to where pregnancy doesnt have to live in your head rent free."
6549,Some people double or triple up for their own comfort but just using the pill on its own isnt any more dangerous.
6550,As long as you take your pill every day around the same time you will be fine.
6551,Everyones advice is great about the effectiveness.
6552,But I just want to add that before making this decision you should also consider your age and the politics of where you live.
6553,Even though the effectiveness of bc if taken correctly is 99 effective you need to think about what would happen IF you did get pregnant.
6554,Would you be able to get an abortion legally?
6555,"If not, are you able to get somewhere you can or are you able to take care of a child?"
6556,"If any of those answer are no, I would still add a second form of protection."
6557,He can finish inside you!

6587,She noticed on the IUD there was a persistent hard inflammation in her lower abdomen that didnt go away.
6588,Once it was out (and she felt so much better) she switched to the pill and thats when the her sex drive went into a tail spin.She recently couldnt take the lack of desire to have sex so she quit the pill.There are lot of posts about when women go off the pill their libido returns eventually.
6589,Im just curious if there is something that can be done.

6630,I was scrolling through tiktok and found a comment saying liquid chlorophyll can stop your birth control from being affective?
6631,I didnt know this was a thing and my doctor hasnt told me anything about it.
6632,What are some things I should be aware of that will stop my birth control from not being effective?
6633,"Some antibiotics, St Johns wort which is a natural herbal remedy, being sick or having diaoreah (I can never spell that word) within a few hours after taking the pill, and I feel there are a few more things but this is what I remember off the top of my head."
6634,Its been a while since I was on it.
6635,and grapefruit juice!

6640,Charcoal
6641,This made me laugh  Diarrhea
6642,Do you know why being sick or having diarrhea would affect it ?
6643,I never thought of them being able to and this saddens me since Im currently sick rn
6644,"this is not true, please stop spreading misinformation."
6645,"Grapefruit juice contains an enzyme that may increase side effects of birth control, it does not lower effectiveness."
6646,Oh no!
6647,I love grapefruit juice ( what about cranberry juice or pineapple juice I drink them a lot too
6648,Yeah I cant spell lmao
6649,Take that with a grain of salt.
6650,I have IBS and constantly have shit running through me (literally) and I havent gotten pregnant on the pill.
6651,I didnt know it was misinformation myself.
6652,Thats what my doctor told me when i started bc
6653,grapefruit juice is fine.
6654,So is cranberry and pineapple
6655,grapefruit juice is dangerous with certain SSRIs but no issues with BC )
6656,"Either you misunderstood or your Dr was wrong, because there's only a theoretical chance that it could even increase side effects."
6657,"Theoretically, consuming grapefruit with birth control pills might increase the estrogen levels in your blood."
6658,"This shouldn't lower the effectiveness of your birth control, but it might increase the chances for side effects like breast tenderness, nausea, changes in uterine bleeding, blood clots, or breast cancer."
6659,(I'm only commenting so that other people don't think this is true.
6660,"I'm 2 years into my second Mirena  find it pretty good overall for a BC option, however recently I have decided to start the process of freezing my eggs and the initial tests have found I have a large ovarian cyst on my left ovary."
6661,"Due to this they have recommended not to go ahead with the egg freezing and to wait until it goes away, however it's been a couple of months and there has been no improvement.I have low ovarian reserve for my age (33) and have been told that it's imperative I freeze eggs sooner rather than later as time is ticking, so now I am wondering whether removing the Mirena will help get rid of the cysts quicker?"
6662,"Or prevent more from forming?I've been on some sort of hormonal BC for over 16 years so I am hesitate to take it out, but if anyone has found an improvement I am willing to give it a try."

6667,Hey yall.
6668,27F here and I am afraid to go off the pill.
6669,Ive only been on it for a year and a half.
6670,"It has been helping me with my acne, pms, and keeping my period light and regular."
6671,"Prior to the pill, I would be extra sensitive, pick fights with my partner, have terrible cystic acne on my cheeks, and have heavy periods."
6672,Also my periods were never regular.
6673,I would sometimes go months without my period and sometimes it would stabilize.
6674,"Ive heard of people having bad symptoms while on the pill, but for me I have bad symptoms off the pill and I am scared to stop taking them."
6675,"And Im sure youre thinking, just stay on the pill then."
6676,Well Im very curious now I feel like I am masking my true self with taking pills.
6677,I want to learn how to deal with the real me.
6678,"I want to learn how to manage my pms, my acne, etc."
6679,Has anyone else experienced terrible symptoms off of the pill and what was your journey like?
6680,"If you really want to go off the pill, you won't know how it affects you until you try it."
6681,"Some people experience an adjustment period for their hormones to return to normal, others dont."
6682,But your hormones will eventually return to how they were before you started taking the pill so the negative aspects of this will also likely return.
6683,"You shouldn't think of this as not 'naturally' you, however."
6684,There is a lot of anti birth control movements currently and a lot of influencers claiming natural is better.
6685,Thats not always the case.
6686,"If you have a hormone imbalance, that can also 'mask' the real you."
6687,Pms can make you act irrationally and how you would not act otherwise.
6688,Acne can ruin your self confidence.
6689,Hormone imbalances can have a detrimental impact and control your life.
6690,"For many people, hormone imbalances can only be control by birth control."
6691,And there is nothing wrong with that.
6692,Its like a diabetic taking their insulin.
6693,"Of course, you can try to balance your hormones 'naturally', but for a large proportion of people that does not work."
6694,"And, what is 'natural' anyway?"
6695,"One could argue vitamins and supplements are not natural either.Anyway, of course you should try stopping the pill if you want to."
6696,You won't know how it feels until you try.
6697,But if your quality of life is much better on it... whats the point?
6698,People need to stop demonising birth control and acting like it changes your character more than other medications when that is simply not the case.
6699,There is nothing wrong with needing medicine to treat a medical condition.
6700,If your body is currently feeling better on the pill then its likely the pill is balancing any kind of hormonal issue you may have off of it.
6701,The pill doesnt stop you from being your true self but it can treat issues like any medication.
6702,Just be aware the issues you had before will likely come back.

6715,TW selfharm mentionSorry in advance for the long post.I got Kyleena inserted almost 2 months ago and I'm really struggling here.
6716,"Other than bleeding nonstop since I got it, I haven't had any negative physical side effects."
6717,But I do feel like my mental health is suffering big time.
6718,"The past few weeks I have felt horribly depressed, insecure, and irritable."
6719,I have struggled with depression and anxiety off and on for many years but this is definitely the worst I have felt in a long time.
6720,"Not only do I feel super insecure about every aspect of my life and my body, I also feel emotionally distant from my boyfriend to the point where I feel like I need to break up with him, even though there's no good rational reason to."
6721,We're currently long distance and I haven't even seen him since I got the IUD.
6722,I was really looking forward to seeing him and being intimate again but now just the thought of sex repulses me.
6723,I almost 9 years clean from selfharm but I've had the urge lately to relapse.
6724,I'm also so anxious about the IUD somehow failing and me ending up pregnant anyway despite all this.The worst part is that I don't even know if all of this is related to my IUD.
6725,"Since I've struggled with my mental health before, maybe it's just a coincidence that all this is happening now."
6726,"I talked to my doctor about it and she said it's possible that the IUD could be making my mood worse, but that I should get better once my body fully adjusts.I know that many others on this sub have talked about their IUD making them feel depressed."
6727,"But my question is if you did have similar side effects, did they get better over time?"
6728,"I really don't want to get it removed because I know that trying something else would be equally risky, so I feel like I should just give it some time to see if I feel better."
6729,"I was so excited right after I got the IUD because the insertion went really smoothly for me and I've felt mostly normal physically, so I really thought it was going to be a great fit for me."
6730,But I don't know how long I can deal with this.
6731,I'm so frustrated because what's even the point of being on birth control if I'm too disgusted with myself to even have sex?
6732,I seriously want to cry writing this.TLDR I think IUD is killing my mental health.
6733,"Depressed, insecure, no sex drive, emotionally distant from bf, want to hurt myself."
6734,Doctor said it should get better.
6735,"If this happened to you, did it ever actually improve?"
6736,"If you're feeling an increased risk of relapsing and selfharming after nearly a decade, get the IUD out."
6737,"Like now, that's serious."
6738,It's still a form of hormonal bc and it can very much have mental and emotional side effects.
6739,"My friend had her Kyleena for 2 years and takes medication for her mental health, and the Kyleena made her anxiety much worse and increased depression until she got it removed."
6740,It's not for everyone.
6741,"If you're miserable and don't even want to have sex on top of it, what's the point of being on bc?"
6742,"Pregnancy prevention shouldn't matter more than your quality of life.If you're unhappy with exploring more hormonal bc, you might want to look at using/combining several nonhormonal options."
6743,"In a pinch, there are always condoms."
6744,"I had the same symptoms, got mine removed and it took a couple months to recover, but I have."
6745,I had issues with it.
6746,Turns out I don't tolerate hormones well.
6747,Switched to Phexxi.
6748,"(Ended up getting pregnant because its not as effective, but I'm okay with it)"
6749,"I didn't think I had any mental side effects from my IUD because a lot of changes happened all at once in my life got the IUD, graduated high school, moved away for college, etc."
6750,"But over the 8 years I had a hormonal IUD (first mirena then kyleena) I was anxious, depressed, had thoughts of self harm, etc."
6751,I got my IUD removed almost a year ago and I can say within a month I felt like a completely different person.
6752,"I am now only a reasonably anxious person, I don't ruminate on absurd anxieties anymore, I never think about harming myself, in overall happier."
6753,I can definitely tell that my mood fluctuates throughout my menstrual cycle but I feel infinitely better now and am so much more stable.
6754,"Before I would cry at the drop of a hat, and couldn't hold a difficult conversation with anyone without shutting down and silently crying."
6755,Overall all of my relationships are better.
6756,"All this to say, kyleena is supposed to be one of the lowest dose hormonal IUDs, and it still can cause mental side effects."
6757,"It might get better it might not, but every doctor will tell you to wait it out and see."
6758,Ultimately it's up to you to decide if waiting 36 months is worth it to see if you start to feel better.
6759,I had a ton of mental side effects after getting mine.
6760,I almost broke off my engagement.
6761,"I felt psycho for the first 3 months, after that it finally calmed down a little, but Id still get pretty moody."
6762,It killed my sex drive and I gained weight that I still havent been able to lose 4 months after getting it removed.
6763,I will never get a hormonal iud again.
6764,I wont even recommend them for anyone.
6765,Wondering if Im experiencing mood changes with my IUD too.
6766,I seem way more irritable then usual and not like myself.
6767,I already struggle with anxiety  depression but this feels different.
6768,Ive had Kyleena in for 3 months.
6769,But am going to ask to get it removed this week  will see if I notice a difference!
6770,(want it out to regulate my body again  try for a baby eventually  scared of ectopic pregnancies)  I also am sensitive to hormones especially when they are synthetic.
6771,If you decide to get it out I hope it helps!
6772,I can always update you if I notice a difference with my experience!

6806,This Plan b gave me 2 long periods in one month
6807,I thought it would only affect me the month of not the following month .
6808,Im confused and low key scared.
6809,"I had unprotected sex August 27th, I immediately took Plan B after sex 45 days before ovulation day."
6810,On Sept 3rd6th I was bleeding (not spotting).
6811,Fast forward its the 17th I was supposed to start my period on the 15th.
6812,I took a pregnancy test today (ClearBlue test) and it came back as Negative/Not Pregnant.
6813,Is this normal?
6814,Did I have an early period?
6815,Or what?
6816,The times I've taken a plan b it has messed with my period dates.
6817,I wouldn't be concerned.
6818,Maybe take a test again in a week to be sure
6819,The times I took Plan B rlly messed up my cycle and I bled before my period.
6820,That's completely normal.
6821,Good on you for taking Plan B right away
6822,Did you take an emergency contraceptive
6823,yeah i think so.
6824,i took a plan b 3 weeks ago during my period and usually my periods are 4 weeks apart but my period just came a week eatly

6829,I did!
6830,Sorry I forgot to add that into my post.
6831,"then thats what caused the bleeding, its a very common side effect."
6832,"emergency contraceptives can delay periods r/planbsa test is accurate two weeks after sex and definitive after three, use condoms if you dont want to get pregnant"
6833,Irregular bleeding (including delayed/ missed/ early periods) is an extremely common side effect of plan b.
6834,"A negative test is definitive 21 days after sex and August 27 was 21 days ago, so youre not pregnant."
6835,"For little context I'm 24 and this is my first experience with birth control, ever."
6836,"I've had my Nexplanon for a little over 3 months, it's great so far but my period has changed drastically it lasts a week instead of 4/5 days like before and it's 100 painless now (I used to get huge cramps and sore legs)."
6837,I've also been spotting for a week prior to my period and I couldn't handle only having 2 weeks free of bleeding a month so I took 2000mg (2 capsules) of EPO on the first day of my spotting and it all went away within 48hrs.
6838,Kept taking it for the whole week and I stopped 24hrs before my period was due but it never came!
6839,"It basically skipped it, it's been 3 weeks and I'm now starting to spot again but it's the right timing according to my period tracker."
6840,I have had no side effects aside from a little cramping here and there.
6841,Is that safe?
6842,Anyone has had this happen to them as well?
6843,In an ideal world I would just take the epo for a week once a month and be free of periods but it feels very odd to not be bleeding after having regular periods for nearly 9 years.

6869,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
6870,I had all the symptoms you described  I also have a 5 year old that I became pregnant with while I had the implant.
6871,Definitely glad I made a Drs appointment!
6872,"I did get pregnant while on Nexplanon, but unfortunately had a miscarriage / hoping my dr agrees with me and just takes it out"
6873,"So me and my ex broke up about 2 and a half months ago, we were sexually active."
6874,"She was on oral birth control and skipped sugar pills and just took the medicated ones because periods were painful, and he doctor recommended her to do this."
6875,"We used condoms, and 50/50 used pull out method with condoms."
6876,"Anyways the last time we were sexually actively ( 2 and a half months ago ) she ended up drinking charcoal in the hospital later that night, Ive read this can deactivate birth control  any truth to this?"
6877,"We dont have any contact with each other now, and she doesnt post on socials but Ive heard she put on a little bit of weight from mutual friends."
6878,Anyways Im paranoid she is pregnant and keeping it a secret or maybe even doesnt know?
6879,Ive always been paranoid about this kind of stuff and really just wanna know if I have some genuine concerns or if Im just being paranoid.
6880,"If you used condoms and sometimes pullout, you do not need to worry about pregnancy."
6881,I don't know about how charcoal interacts but I can imagine it would negate her pill if taken close enough together.
6882,"However, if she reliably takes her pills and takes them continuously without sugar pills, she would still be protected for a break no longer than the number of sugar pills in her pack (usually 4 or 7) as long as she then continued her pills."
6883,Add in that you use condoms and sometimes also pull out  I think odds of pregnancy would be extremely low.
6884,Activated charcoal inhibits the absorption of pretty much all oral medication (including birth control pills).
6885,"If someone takes a birth control pill less than 3 hours before ingesting activated charcoal, or takes one less than 12 hours after ingesting charcoal, its a missed pill."
6886,"Otherwise, its fine."
6887,"Regardless of the timeline, you dont have anything to worry about."
6888,"She took her birth control continuously, so her protection definitely wouldnt lapse after just one missed pill."

6893,100 ?
6894,This is not true.
6895,Comdoms and especially pullingout are the least reliable form of birth control.
6896,Thank you!
6897,Im in a very stressful time of my life (first year uni) and living by myself and just stressin.
6898,Im just imagining coming back to my home town and seeing her with like a massive baby bump
6899,"Well she took her birth control at around 10 pm, and went to hospital around 2 so it wouldnt even qualify as a missed pill"
6900,its never 100 but extremely low.
6901,after 2 months shes probably fine
6902,Thats just plain wrongCondoms are 98 effective with perfect use and 87 effective with typical use over a year.
6903,Pullout is 96 effective with perfect use and 78 effective with typical use over a year.
6904,Using them together makes it around 99.92 effective with perfect use and 96.2 effective with typical use.
6905,"(The least effective form of birth control is spermicide, coming in at only 82 effective with perfect use over a year."
6906,Take the time to read up about this before commenting!
6907,They are pretty reliable when combined.
6908,I really don't think you need to worry based on the info you've given here.
6909,"Take care of yourself, hopefully your stress will calm down a bit as you find your new more independent routine at university."
6910,I have read up on it and guess what??
6911,Most people do not use condoms with perfect use.
6912,"Even if you do, they can break."
6913,"Hell, most people dont use condoms at all."
6914,And youve got to be stupid to think pulling out is reliable and theres no perfect use for pulling out.
6915,Precum can cause pregnancy.
6916,I know the truth hurts to hear but Im gonna tell it.
6917,"If you arent mature enough to be on birth control AND use condoms at the same time unless in a monogamous relationship, YOU DONT NEED TO BE HAVING SEX!"
6918,What are you talking about?
6919,I just gave you sources with the statistics.
6920,Sure not everyone uses them perfectly every time but OP did not mention any condoms breaking.
6921,"(and BTW typical use rates are for cases where condoms break or the user doesnt use them properly ) Its not the truth, saying condoms and especially pulling out are the least reliable form of birth control is just plain wrong, and i just told you how its wrong."
6922,Literally just look at the numbers And youve got to be stupid to think pulling out is reliable and theres no perfect use for pulling out.Perfect use of pullout is a thing the 96 yearly rate takes into account the risk of precum.
6923,Read the links( I provided you before writing paragraphs spewing misinformation.
6924,"If you arent mature enough to be on birth control AND use condoms at the same time unless in a monogamous relationship, YOU DONT NEED TO BE HAVING SEX!Again.. what are you talking about?"
6925,Did you even read the post?
6926,Who are you attacking here?
6927,OP used condoms and pullout together while his partner is ALSO on the pill.
6928,"And thats not necessary to do either, all birth control methods are designed with the assumption that your partner is finishing inside you and the efficacy rates are based on that."
6929,Stop fear mongering and shaming people.
6930,Big yikes!
6931,so i was wondering if ill be fine to not take my next pack of bc.
6932,"i want to stop but the last time my bf and i had sex, he finished inside of me on 9/9 and he then pulled out on 9/13."
6933,is it okay that i stop?
6934,are my chances high?
6935,im just worried i could still get pregnant even though sperm lasts up to 10 days in the vagina.
6936,im on my last day of placebo btw!!
6937,please answers help
6938,You must take 7 active pills following any unprotected sex.
6939,Withdrawal is not protected sex as it is not sufficient protection.
6940,Take the first week of your next pack and then you can stop.
6941,Use condoms for that full first week and then going forward.
6942,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.

6944,"First read the Mistake or Pregnancy Risk sticky( or the Consolidated Experience post( If this is an experience post please consider adding it to the listPlanned Parenthood online chat(The rules and additional resources can be found on the About / Sidepage (desktop users look to the right and Reddit app up top).I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
6945,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
6946,thank you i was looking for this.
6947,i wasnt sure if stopping after placebo week was good enough or another 7 or 14 or 21 were good thank you again
6948,"Youre only protected during the placebo week if youve taken 21 consecutive active pills, dont lengthen the placebos beyond 7 days, and restart your next actives on time."
6949,That third one is whats relevant here.
6950,"The placebo week isnt offering you any protection because the pills are just sugar pills, youre only protected because of the pills you take before and after that week."
6951,You will need to use condoms going forward.
6952,This would be a good time to practice and ensure you and your partner can nail proper use.
6953,"( The typical use efficacy of condoms is quite a bit lower than the typical efficacy of the pill, so getting as close to perfect use as possible is very important."
6954,so taking another 7 days is a good idea?
6955,Yes because you had sex on the 13th which was only 34 days ago (depending on your time zone) and sperm can live for up to 5 days.
6956,Take the full first week and provided you dont have any condomless sex you can stop.
6957,actually i got the dates mixed up he finished inside me on the 5th then pulled out on the 8th
6958,The 8th was a lot more than a week ago.
6959,If youre 100 certain of that date you wont need a week of pills.
6960,You can just toss the placebos and start using condoms straight away.
6961,thank you so much
6962,So I had unprotected sex on Sunday morning (36am ish) I use the Flo app and it says that I should be ovulating around Monday/Tuesday.
6963,"I took Plan B less than 72 hours after the intercourse, should I worry or am I gonna be okay?"
6964,Apps arent accurate at tracking ovulation.
6965,Plan B is very effective if you havent ovulated yet.
6966,Theres a max 30 chance per cycle.
6967,A test is accurate 2 weeks after sex and definitive after 3.
6968,Make sure to use condoms or talk to your doctor about birth control if youre not wanting to get pregnant.

6995,So I've been thinking about getting on birth control lately bc I wanna be safe obviously and me and my bf are getting pretty sick of condoms.
6996,"However I never really knew how many types of birth control there were, more or less the different names for said birth control."
6997,"The clinic near me offers the pill and a shot, but today I was having a conversation with my aunt and she told me that the one she used to be on and the one her daughter is on causes them to get their periods only 4 times a year, clear up their acne and keep them skinny while getting rid of period pains."
6998,"I'm a little curious now, what all types of birth control are there and does anyone have any advice/personal experiences that works for them?"
6999,"There are pills(progesterone only and Progesterone and estrogen and there are ton of different brands), Hormonal IUDs(most commonly Mirena, Kyleena, and liletta), copper IUDs, vaginal rings(anovera that lasts a year and nuvaring thats a new ring each month), depo provera the shot, the birth control patch, and arm implants(implannon and nexplanon)."

7004,It depends on what you have planned for the future do you want kids in the upcoming years?
7005,Or are you looking for something long term?
7006,"Are you okay with it being invasive (iud insertion, implant in your arm) or would you rather it be like a pill you take?"
7007,"Personally I've chosen the Nexplanon implant, it has the highest rating of protection, lasts 3/5 years (i dont want kids ever), the insertion is pretty invasive but it felt better than having an iud."
7008,I also know I can't be bothered to remember to take a pill every day at the same time for the rest of my life.
7009,It all depends on your lifestyle.
7010,Also remember that everyone's experience with bc is different.
7011,"You may or may not get the same effects as your relatives do and thats normal, just dont go for something you wouldn't usually take in hopes it works for you like it works for them."
7012,"Do your research, there are a lot experiences shared in this subreddit (though you should take them with a grain of salt, we as humans tend to share bad experiences more than good ones) and there's sites with charts and lots of info on different bc.I hope you find what works best for you soon!"
7013,There are two broad types of hormonal birth control combined/with estrogen and progestinonly.
7014,"The BC methods with estrogen are the combined pill, the patch (replaced weekly) and the ring (replaced monthly or yearly depending on the type)."
7015,"Those methods are good if you want less acne, a withdrawal bleeding (period) every month or if you want to control when you get your period.It sounds like your cousin is on a combined pill."
7016,"Combined pills have different estrogen doses and progestin types, so side effects and benefits can vary depending on the formulation."
7017,"Progestinonly methods include the minipill/POP, the shot, the arm implant and hormonal IUDs."
7018,"Unlike methods with estrogen they don't increase the risk of blood clots at all, so they are good if you are at higher risk to begin with."
7019,"Some people can take estrogen but they are sensitive to it, and have fewer side effects with progestinonly methods."
7020,"The shot lasts for 3 months and the implant and IUDs last for years, they are low maintenance and more effective with typical use."
7021,"The main side effect is irregular bleeding, but many people stop having their period."
7022,Here you can compare all birth control methods
7023,Hi there!

7031,"Hi all,I've had the jaydess IUD inserted for about 40 hours and I have been experiencing the most agonizing cramping I have ever experienced."
7032,"It doesn't feel like normal cramps, it's mostly right ovary centered and I can feel it from stomach to back, and when it's really intense I can feel it descending down my legs almost."
7033,It is agonizing.
7034,The pain is to the point where I am vomiting and unable to walk.
7035,The doctor checked with an ultrasound to ensure it was in the right place before leaving the office and all was fine.
7036,"I'm taking 100mg of ketum and spasafom every few hours as well as using a heating pad, and I am not noticing any difference or relief."
7037,Something I've noticed is the pain is much more intense after eating.
7038,I have a high pain tolerance.
7039,Insertion was quite painful but this cramping is much worse.
7040,"I initially got the IUD to manage my elongated, painful periods but this is far far worse than what I dealt with originally."
7041,It's only been 40 hours so I'm hoping over the next few days it decreases.

7058,i am just in need of some advice.
7059,i was on kyleena for about a year and got it out this april bc i was going thru a breakup and didnt feel like i needed it anymore.
7060,then a couple months later i decided to try going on the old bc pill kariva that i used to take bc it helped my acne and my acne had gotten pretty bad towards the end of kyleena  after getting it removed.
7061,i ended up taking one pack of kariva and decided i just wanted to take a break from birth control bc i convinced myself i was gaining weight even tho i wasnt (body dysmorphia lol).
7062,"now, its been about a month since stopping the pill and i feel like ive gained some weight but again it might be in my head."
7063,im also 22 so im at an age where you naturally gain weight?
7064,idk its so hard to pinpoint this type of stuff.
7065,my stomach just feels like its gained a little more chubbiness and im getting frustrated bc im scared that with all this birth control switching ive ruined my body and destroyed my hormone levels.
7066,"i know im probably overthinking, but im so stressed."
7067,"i made an appointment with my doctor to talk abt it cuz i havent really been getting my period consistently since getting my iud removed as well, but its also been a really emotional year for me so it could also be from that."
7068,"i would love to find a birth control that works well for me bc eventually im gonna be sexually active again and need it, but i just feel like i messed everything up with switching around so much over the last couple months."
7069,i guess im just looking for some advice or reassurance bc im feeling a little insane right now hahaha.
7070,Birth control is out of your system a week after stopping it.
7071,"Youre at a very normal age to gain weight, between 22 and 23 I know I gained at least 15 pounds despite staying just as active."
7072,This doesnt sound like a birth control issue especially since youve been gaining weight even after stopping because you thought you were gaining weight.
7073,I will say though its normal to experience side effects the first few months on any method so a month isnt really long enough to tell anything unless youre having severe reactions.

7078,I completely understand what youre going through.
7079,"I am also 22, recently switched around birth control, and was worried about the same thing."
7080,"If youre seriously concerned about fucking up your hormones I would highly suggest looking into something nonhormonal or the mini pill, so long as you dont need to be on birth control for hormonal imbalances or anything."
7081,"I found that my constant stress that I was permanently damaging my body and my hormones wasnt worth it to keep taking the combo pill I was on, so I stopped it, then got on the progesterone only pill, and the peace of mind it has given me has already been incredible."
7082,"I was worried that switching around would mess me up but its perfectly fine to switch between methods until you find one that works for you people do it all the time.With that being said, you definitely havent permanently damaged anything."
7083,Hormones from birth control dont stay in your body for that long (especially the pill thats why its so important to take it on time and never skip one to ensure you dont get pregnant!
7084,"), and you werent on either form for a super long time either, so youre okay."
7085,"You didnt mess everything up, and everything youre experiencing is definitely just a byproduct of being 22 and having an emotionally intensive year."
7086,Im in a very similar placeI think mostly everyone at this age is!
7087,Just think about how many people are on hormonal birth control for years and years and switch to various different methods and never have any issues!
7088,"It takes a lot of trial and error to find one that works for you, so switching methods is just a natural part of it."
7089,"Youll be okay, and your hormones will be okay, but seriously, I cant recommend a non hormonal or progesterone only form of birth control enough if its a serious concern for you."
7090,"Knowing that its not fucking with my hormones as bad has been so, so nice."
7091,"Just took my first pill today , overall dont feel any side effects which I presume is good."
7092,Im Curious to if anyone else has ever tried it or is currently using this pill.
7093,"If so , do you have any notable parts of your experience or side effects ?"

7099,I took a similar one to Lo Loestrin Fe which was Larin Fe 1/20.
7100,It worked well for me for almost two years until I found out that I cant have estrogen because of my migraines with aura.
7101,Im now have Nexplanon.

7104,"I was on Lolo from the age of 1820 Prior to lolo, i had heavy and irregular periods that lasted a week."
7105,"After lolo tho was great!best BC ive been on, my periods completely stopped and i didnt get any side effects other than sore boobs for a few months (they looked good but were sooo painful) I recently started having sex with a man, which meant I had to switch because my adhd makes it difficult to remember to take it on time and i am NOT risking pregnancy."
7106,"I switched to the Mirena IUD 9 months ago and my period is back, extremely irregular (although extremely light) and im just toughing it out  But yeah if Mirena doesnt work out I might just use the paragard and/or go back on lolo for the hormonal affect idk"

7125,Hi!
7126,I am a 17yearold girl who has been on and off birth control for years due to endo.
7127,"I believe I'm allergic or something is wrong with my hormone balance because every time I go on new birth control, I start having stabbing migraines and pelvic pain."
7128,This has happened with every single birth control I have taken.
7129,"(around 710, lost count honestly) I had to be taken off around the 2month mark because the pain was too unbearable."
7130,"Now, my main problem is that I have been taking this new birth control called RECLIPSEN."
7131,It has been the most manageable of all.
7132,"I still have pain, but with a few Advils, it chills."
7133,My main issue with this birth control is the amount of water weight I have gained.
7134,"I had endo surgery two weeks ago, and probably some water weight is also caused by it, but after starting RECLIPSEN, I have become more and more bloated and puffy every day that goes by."
7135,"If anyone has had a similar situation, please let me know how to eliminate all this water weight."
7136,"I'm unsure when I'll be able to exercise due to the surgery, so that's probably out of the question."

7153,No worries.
7154,The implant is right under the skin so it shouldnt be impacted by muscle movement.

7170,I had unprotected intercourse on sun 9/10.
7171,I took emergency contraceptive (Aftera) a few hours that same day.
7172,Im on the mini pill (Norabe) but do not always use it perfectly (but make sure to take it everyday within 3 hours or sometimes later ( ).
7173,I started bleeding bright/dark red blood on Tuesday 9/12.
7174,Ive been bleeding ever since but has increased like a period with cramping.
7175,Its still bright red most times which worries me.
7176,Ive had an ectopic before on my left fallopian tube and feel cramps and twinges on that side.
7177,I typically feel cramps and twinges on that side when I have period cramps likely due to the scar tissue.Has anyone ever had bright red bleeding and cramping for a number days after the emergency contraceptive?Ive taken plan b and aftera before but have never experienced this type of bleeding right after taking it.
7178,Not sure if this could be my period nowAlso I know Im not pregnant because I hadnt had sex since June 2023.
7179,Im going to wait to take a pregnancy test 2 weeks from 9/10

7202,21FI've had a nexplanon implant since July of this year.
7203,"I've yet to hit that 3 month mark so my body is continuing to adjust to the hormones.So far, the negatives outweigh the positives greatly."
7204,My mental health is suffering big time.
7205,"I'm subconsciously isolating myself from others, then consequently feeling more alone and bathing in these negative thoughts without any outside support."
7206,"I've become chronophobic (fearful of time passing) and convincing myself that soon I'll be old, ugly, and worthless, that no man or woman will want me or love me or be with me, and that I'll be alone.I need to set up a therapy appointment, I know, lol."
7207,"I plan to do so as soon as the weekend is up and the office opens.I've started comparing myself to people that are my age and even those that are far older than me, even if they're living their best life."
7208,"I can't help but think that once I'm not longer considered ""young"", my life will simply be miserable and I'll be alone and disgusting."
7209,"It's on my mind 24/7, it's the first thing I think of when I wake up and probably one of the last things to cross my mind before I fall asleep."
7210,"Every task I do, I wonder to myself ""Why am I even trying?"
7211,Eventually I'm going to die and it won't matter if I keep my area clean or if I take good care of myself.
7212,"""I KNOW these thoughts are irrational but they're causing me insane distress."
7213,I no longer have any desire to do things I once loved to do.
7214,I feel like this is simply depression but the thought of me climbing out of this mindset seems so out of reach.
7215,I haven't spoken with any friends about this because none that I know of use nexplanon or any other hormonal birth control.
7216,A lot of my closest friends are AMAB so they don't understand just how intense these thoughts and feelings are.
7217,I feel like they'll see me as too mentally unstable and distance themselves.
7218,I feel so alone.

7237,I mean if the generic Yasmin is working well for you I wouldn't risk changing hormonal formulas just so that it is officially continuous.
7238,If the same formula is available in a continuous format then sure just for simplicity's sake switch over but otherwise I wouldn't risk your wellbeing by swapping over what should NOT be an issue at the pharmacy.
7239,"If the pharmacist/tech says anything just tell them this is how your doctor prescribed it for you and if need be file a complaint because this is a very common way for BC to be prescribed for a variety of conditions and no one should be making you feel bad for it.Edit to add you should ask your doctor if s/he can write the Rx for 3 months at a time too, helps to avoid these issues a bit."

7297,I found Alesse wasnt enough to regulate my periods while on Spiro.
7298,I tried it for three months with no change.
7299,"But its a great place to start because it has a lower dose of hormones, and that may be all you need to keep things regular.Endo put me on a higher dose pill next."
7300,She chose Diane35 (available in Canada but not in the US) because the progestin cyproterone acetate was also an antiandrogen.
7301,"I was really frightened of birth control too, and of the fact that Diane35 can have a slightly higher risk of blood clots in certain situations, but it worked well for me and I was on Diane and Spiro for about eight years."
7302,"I got to a point where, with laser hair removal, I no longer shaved or plucked every day, and my acne was almost nonexistent so I barely ever wore makeup."
7303,I also loved having control over when to have a period.
7304,It was a great time.
7305,"Dont hesitate to ask your endo or your pharmacist  questions before you start, to put your mind at ease."
7306,Everyones experience can be different.
7307,thank you for such a detailed response!
7308,unfortunately my endo never explains much she sees me for 10 mins maybe 20. im rlly scared of weight gain and hairloss on BC ive heard so many stories and im scared itll add onto my already bad hairfall and weight issues.
7309,spiro SAVED my skin and im willing to tolerate the two periods but that def made my iron drop which made my hairloss worse.
7310,so idt my endo will increase my dose until i agree to go on bc.
7311,i just feel so stressed cuz i dont understand what exactly bc does and idk if i have the mental capacity to go the trial and error rn since im busy with uni.
7312,i just dont know what type of help to ask for atp
7313,It sounds like youre dealing with a lot of the worst parts of PCOS.
7314,Even anxiety is considered part of the syndrome now.
7315,My heart goes out to you.
7316,"I promise this stuff is all treatable, but it is definitely a trial and error thing, as everyone is so different."
7317,"It also takes a while to see changes when hormones are behind it, at least three months, before you can say if something is working for you or not."
7318,"It is a process, and its hard to be patient when the symptoms are so hard to live with."
7319,"I was just starting uni myself when I finally decided to stop listening to my male gp telling me it was just something I had to live with, and went to a female gp for a referral to an endo."
7320,"After so long trying to endure it, I just wanted it fixed."
7321,"It helped me sometimes to just think that whether it works or not, I am taking a step closer to finding what works for me."
7322,"Other times, I admit it felt hopeless, and thats when journaling or talking to other people helped.Birth control basically stops you from ovulating, and gives you artificial hormones to simulate a normal cycle."
7323,There are a few reasons this can help with PCOS symptoms.
7324,The best book I read about how our bodies and hormones work is The Period Repair Manual by Lara Briden.
7325,"Its aimed at people who dont want to use pharmaceutical interventions like birth control, but it really helped me understand whats going on in my body."
7326,"You can check if your public library has a copy, maybe even an ebook copy.If you decide to read it, just remember that there is no right way to go about treating PCOS, because its so different for everyone."
7327,You can even combine both pharmaceutical and natural methods to get the maximum benefit.
7328,Dont let anyone make you feel bad for wanting to go one way or the other.
7329,"hey, i cannot thank you enough for your response this was so kind, informative and understanding."
7330,"it honestly is very difficult, im only 21 and it sucks to have to deal with this while i see my peers living much easier lives."
7331,i got diagnosed at 15 and ive ignored my pcos for years cuz i was never given many options.
7332,then i finally asked to be put on spiro a few months ago and simply having somewhat clear skin and realizing that it wasnt my fault and was all internal had been SO freeing.
7333,unfortunately other symptoms are still there and im still trying to understand whats happening in my body.
7334,your absolutely right that at least im taking a step towards helping myself instead of doing nothing.
7335,im definitely gonna get my hands on that book during my break this semester.
7336,i do believe in holistic medicine but i think im currently leaning towards doing a mix of both.
7337,im hoping the spiro brings my androgens down and then i can continue working out and lose this weight.
7338,im taking iron supplements and rlly hoping that this will help me lose weight and bring my hair back.
7339,i just really dont want to be on birth control at the end of my degree.
7340,its just so unpredictable and im just scared to put myself through that right now.
7341,my current spiro dose has acc increased my androgens which i dont understand how but ill be asking to get a dose increase and to see if my cycles level out with the higher dose.
7342,its def a gamble cuz this can result in worsening side effects but i guess its worth a shot since im already on this medication and it wont be smth new im introducing.
7343,btw what did u end up doing to help manage your pcos symptoms?
7344,Is plan B still effective after around 48 hours?

7376,Ive recently been having lower back pain and cramping here and there.
7377,I am on the pill and we use condoms.
7378,I get a lot of symptoms throughout my cycle due to my period but I usually get lower back pains about 2 weeks before my period.
7379,My period is not until 3 weeks from now.
7380,With my knowledge I have not taken any pills late!
7381,He got a little soft as we were messing around but he said that the condom was not loose.Could this be anything I should worry about?
7382,"No matter how protected I am, I cannot help but stress, worry, and overthink constantly."

7399,?
7400,Anything that isnt penetrative sex
7401,I put only the tip of my penis into my gfs vagina a couple of time without having ejaculating prior and did not even come close to while in there.
7402,Should she take plan b or be worried about a potential pregnancy?Any answers are appreciated and we will be grateful for any helpful insight.
7403,if you didnt finish inside you should be okay but theres always a chance of pregnancy with unprotected sex and a plan b would be good to take just in case
7404,You had unprotected sex so yea she should take a Plan B.
7405,Use condoms next time.

7416,Pulling out isnt a very reliable way to prevent pregnancy.
7417,"It works about 78 of the time, which means that over a year of using this method, 22 out of 100 women  about 1 in 5  would get pregnant."
7418,"By comparison, male condoms are 98 effective when used correctly every time."

7421,The reliability of pull out essentially relies on how well it can be done and theres a high margin of user errror.
7422,Hello all!
7423,"So, as the title says, I've had a literal constant period since my Paraguard was inserted."
7424,I (18 F) got it in on June 1st of 2022.
7425,"It's now September 17th of 2023, and I have not stopped bleeding."
7426,"That sounds like an exaggeration I know, but in this past year and a half there has been maybe two or three days I haven't bled."
7427,"And I don't just mean spotting, I mean I go through at least two overnight pads a day usually."
7428,It's horrible.
7429,It has completely tanked my self confidence.
7430,I haven't been able to enjoy the past two summers because of the constant bleeding.
7431,"I don't know what to do, and looking it up I haven't found anyone in a similar situation."
7432,"I feel incredibly alone on this, and I just want it to stop."
7433,"I did reach out to my doctors, and they said it seems nothing is wrong with the IUD itself."
7434,"The only things they recommend for me were to get it removed, or to go on the pill in addition to the IUD."
7435,"I definitely will not be getting it removed, I didn't go through all that pain just to have it yanked out a year later."
7436,"And as for the pill, it seems hormonal birth controls cause me to gain weight at an alarming rate."
7437,I'd really rather not go back to that as I just lost the 80lbs that my four years of depo put on me.
7438,"I don't know if it's relevant, but my depo completely stopped my periods for the duration I was on it."

7450,"Just a thought, but if you've been consistently bleeding for the past year and it hasn't stopped, there's a chance it wasn't placed correctly, it's moved lower, or your body doesn't like the IUD."
7451,"When I went to the doctor they checked the placement, and said it all seemed fine in that aspect."
7452,"Are there any other side effects for ""my body not liking"" the IUD?"
7453,I don't want to get it removed if I don't absolutely have to.
7454,"Did they do a transvaginal ultrasound, or just a string check?To me, a big indicator is the bleeding for well over a year."
7455,How are you not anemic?
7456,"Honestly, if you are fine with putting up with the bleeding every single day, then so be it."
7457,"You can try combining a BC pill to hopefully stop the bleeding, but that maybe a temporary fix."
7458,I don't think it's normal to bleed daily for over a year.
7459,"When I had mine, I bled lightly for 2 weeks right after insertion leading up to my period, got my period, and then all was normal."
7460,They did both a conventional ultrasound and the transvaginal.
7461,"A string check as well, obviously."
7462,It all seemed fine in all those aspects.
7463,I'm honestly not sure?
7464,"A lot of the time it's like the brown / old blood, or there are days when it's much lighter, but it's always at least one overnight pad a day."
7465,"Though looking at the symptoms, I may be experiencing it?"
7466,I really don't know.I truly worry about hormonal birth control though.

7480,So i took plan B around 3 weeks ago... i wasn't due to ovulate for another 56 days or so .
7481,i was fine the whole week after but for the past 2 weeks i have been bleeding.
7482,first few days were heavy like period heavy and now i've just been spotting off and on.
7483,light flow at times.
7484,pregnancy tests are negative but is there any chance i could be pregnant despite all the bleeding?
7485,i'm also worried about why it's happening for so long.
7486,any help appreciated (
7487,This is just a side effect of the Plan B.
7488,It doesnt mean anything.
7489,Take a test 1421 days after sex.

7565,so i have a kyleena iud but i didnt know that if you have very painful/heavy periods that mirena is the one that is approved to help.
7566,i was toying with the idea of maybe removing my kyleena iud and getting mirena instead.
7567,"however, i saw some people say it made them gain weight, have acne, etc."
7568,however im curious ive already been on the pill for 7 years before and went off just bc i wanted to try a different method.
7569,"it didnt make me break out badly, i didnt gain weight, and i honestly had a pretty good experience."
7570,"since mirena has a higher dose of hormones than kyleena, if i experience side effects wouldnt it just affect me like the pill did??"
7571,im just thinking since the increase in hormones wouldnt even be as large as the hormone dosage on the pill that my pill experience is almost indicative of how mirena may go?
7572,"im seeing if anyone can maybe attest to this, for example if you were on the pill and then were on mirena and it didnt really affect you any differently since your body has already had that larger source of artificial hormones?"
7573,?
7574,combination birth control pills (the most commonly prescribed type) contain both estrogen and progesterone.
7575,"hormonal IUDs only contain progesterone, and they all use the same form of progesterone (levonorgestrel) but in different doses."
7576,it may not have the same effect as combination birth control pills for you  its impossible to know for sure though.
7577,"mirena is specifically approved to help with heavy/ painful periods, but that does not mean the others dont help at all."

7609,I'm on month 2 of desogestrel and am currently 3 days before I'm supposed to have a period.
7610,I've been having all the usual PMS symptoms  but after reading Reddit I'm confused about whether I should expect a period with cerazette or not...?
7611,Do you guys have regular periods on deso/other POPs?
7612,I was on Mirena before and didn't have a period at all for a few months (until it violently expelled) so do POPs work the same way by not letting the uterine lining grow or something?
7613,"Desogestrel works primarily by stopping ovulation, but it also keeps the uterine lining thin."
7614,"Since you don't ovulate, you technically never have a period on desogestrel it's all breakthrough bleeding.But since not everyone's uterine lining reacts in the same way to desogestrel, you could have breakthrough bleeding that feels similar to a regular period."
7615,"You could also have irregular bleeding or no bleeding at all  with progestinonly methods almost anything is possible.Personally, the first two months I had 3 days of light breakthrough bleeding and 10 days of spotting."
7616,"The third month I had a couple of days of light bleeding and no spotting, then I started skipping months."
7617,"Now I would say that it's settled, I know that I can go up to 34 months without bleeding, but when I do bleed often it happens twice in a month."
7618,"I spend less time on my period overall though, and it's very light and painless so I'm not complaining."

7672,My withdrawal bleed usually comes four to five days after stopping my pills.
7673,Im yet to come off BC but Ive been thinking about it.
7674,I havent been off it since originally starting 11 or so years ago.
7675,"Nearly everyday I come on this sub, and I find so many people asking whether or not they'll be protected if they're taking the pill and no other forms of contraceptions.Not a complaint, i'm just genuinely baffled lol."
7676,"Yes, I think sometimes alot of the people the majority of the time are a lot younger."
7677,and it is easier to ask away rather than reeding the booklet etc.
7678,"Personally, before going on the pill, I did alot of hours on research, different methods, different pills etc, spoke to doctor and went from there.I personally find it quite strange to take any medication without doing research."
7679,"But also from a different prospective, I guess alot of people would assume that all would be ok, 100 effective rate since alot of people are on the pill but they are so many things they need to take into account, how the pill is taken, missed pills etc."
7680,"I had a friend who used to take the pill whenever she felt like it but then fell pregnant and said 'but I was on the pill', yes love you was but never took it as prescribed."
7681,I noticed that too.
7682,I think it could be caused by bad or misunderstood sex education.
7683,Some people had abstinenceonly sex ed and were straight up told that birth control is not effective.
7684,"Good sex education often emphasizes that it's better to use hormonal BC and condoms, or that the implant and IUDs are more effective than the pill especially for teens."
7685,That's all true but if explanations are rushed or misunderstood I can see a young person coming to the conclusion that the pill is not reliable enough on its own.
7686,I would be curious to know why many of the people who write here apparently trust pulling out or Plan B  more than their regular birth control though.
7687,I think if I lived somewhere abortion was severely restricted I would freak out too.
7688,"Maybe there could also be a lack of sex ed, I don't think I learned about the pill in sex ed actually."
7689,I think theres a lot of misinformation happening (looking at you tik tok).
7690,I read a post someone asked if they were protected with just the pill and there was a comment insisting that condoms are always necessary because the pill doesnt provide enough protection on its own.
7691,By all means if you feel more comfortable doubling up please do  but if condoms were required thered be a whole lot more of unexpected pregnancies.
7692,People will often insist they take it perfectly everyday and ended up pregnant but dont account for the fact they were taking something else that interacted with it or the couple of days they had stomach issues with vomiting and diarrhea and the pill wasnt absorbed properly.
7693,Me too.
7694,Baffled.
7695,Taken correctly and assuming your partner ejaculates inside you it's 99 effective.
7696,Period.
7697,Talking about the combined pill here of course.
7698,"Firstly, many doctors don't even provide a lot of or even accurate information about the pill (have had 2 doctors insisting on something that booklet and research said otherwise)."
7699,"Secondly, if you don't mind getting pregnant you'd probably not freak out but if you absolutely don't want/can't have kids (or at this point), it's natural to be worried and doubling up, which I see many people on this sub do."
7700,"Thirdly, we just don't know many things about bc because we have no data."
7701,"Sure, some meds weren't supposes to affect my pill but why did I get breakthrough bleeding later than usual when being on certain meds?"
7702,It looks like they affect it after all.
7703,We just don't know.
7704,"How many ""grapefruit juice"" equivalents are there that we have  no idea about?"
7705,Im also very confused on people using the pill who will go and get a emergency contraceptive.
7706,I think thats a change on meaning on the word unprotected.
7707,Unprotected sex used to mean without any sort of protection against pregnancy.
7708,Now it means without condoms.
7709,"So we used to recommend plan B in case of unprotected sex, up to 72 hours."
7710,But Im overly confused with the whole thing as well
7711,I see this about any birth control to be honest I'm like you know what they are for right?
7712,?
7713,I mean for me I struggle with the effectiveness of my pill cause it is my first time on birth control and I cant see if its working with my own eyes so personally Im very anxious about it.
7714,For a lot of people taking BC for the first time its anxiety inducing to just trust a tiny little pill.
7715,I take my pill at the exact same time everyday and never missed plus I use condoms and withdrawal but I still get very anxious.
7716,"I have IBS and am on the pill, and I frequently get diarrhea and morning nausea (like, pretty much daily or every other day), so I double up with condoms."
7717,"Honestly, even without IBS I would double up, because I just had my thyroid radiated for Graves disease and the doctor warned me against getting pregnant for a year."
7718,"I am prochoice but personally dont know what decision I would make, myself, so I just feel much more comfortable being as safe as possible (and my boyfriend is more than happy to wear condoms for our peace of mind)."
7719,"I do want to counter some comments while the pill is 99 effective with both perfect use and perfect conditions (no vomiting, no diarrhea), it is only 93 effective with actual use."
7720,This isnt only referring to people forgetting to take the pill for a day or two it also factors in women getting stomach flus or having digestive issues that impact pill absorption.
7721,Ive seen some comments on this sub saying you dont need condoms if youre on the pill and I just want to say that this might not be the best advice for everyone.
7722,"(I also have a pharmaceutical chemistry degree and work in pharma, so Im very passionate about this!)"
7723,I've thought about this on a few occasions.
7724,I wonder if it's because they've heard of so many accidental pregnancies that they find it hard to believe they could have been prevented so easily.
7725,the pill is one of the least effective forms of hormonal contraception so i understand the anxiety.
7726,my partners ex fianc got pregnant while on the pill and now he has a kid lol

7730,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
7731,"This post reminds me about the worst thing I read about the pill on social media some dumb girl wrote on Twitter ""a friend took the pill without water and they eventually got stuck inside her kidney"" and I was like  this goes even beyond the lack of sex education, some of these kids do not even know how a freaking kidney works!"
7732,It's basic biology.
7733,The worst thing (after the tweet itself) was going through the replies and quotes and people were getting scared because they believed what this kid had posted.
7734,Unbelievable!
7735,"I would be curious to know why many of the people who write here apparently trust pulling out or Plan B more than their regular birth control though.You said it yourself  bad, or no, sex education."
7736,Im from Texas and I cant remember what I learned in sex education/health class.
7737,I knew about condoms but they never went into depth on other forms of birth control.
7738,All the research I did on birth control methods other than condoms was on my own.
7739,"Also, some food (like grapefruit) can interact with the pill too"
7740,"The ""pill plus condoms"" thing, from what I remember as an old, started out as being about STIs."
7741,HIV was still a death sentence and it's not like anyone wants gonorrhea either.
7742,So folks were urged to combine the pill with condoms because the pill doesn't prevent disease transmission.
7743,"Combine that with the antipill astroturfing that's going on (I totally agree about TikTok misinformation), and you get stuff like this."
7744,99.7 if you want to be precise
7745,Using condoms as well as another form of birth control is a good idea anyway because it's the only thing that can protect you from STIs.
7746,"Yes, I fell pregnant on the pill and took it as prescribed."
7747,"I suspect it was from a flu I had in that month, but obviously no way to know for certain."
7748,"As someone with IBD, I was curious about this when being prescribed the pill and my doctor was insistent to say that it wouldnt change the effectiveness."
7749,But reading your comment validated those initial worries for me that I had before going on the pill and it definitely makes sense.
7750,"Pill absorption would be an issue if I cant digest it properly even if I take it on time, so the effectiveness would surely drop."
7751,Ugh
7752,"Imo its really effective,  you just have to take it correctly, its 99.7  effective if you take it as stated."
7753,Those who get pregnant on the pill either do not follow the instructions or take other things which can lower its effectiveness.
7754,But as long as you take it right there's nearly no way you get pregnant.
7755,There also seems to be some preconceived notion that Plan B is a get out of jail free card or that its the same as the abortion pill and they take it blindly without realizing what it does or how it works.
7756,"yeah my sex ed was dont have sex until marriage, stay pure for your husband."
7757,"we received absolutely no amount of coverage of sex itself, STDs, or pregnancy/pregnancy prevention."
7758,We watched a birth video to see the miracle of childbirth and talked about how to be a good godly woman.
7759,"I would definitely trust your doctor over me, as its only suspected that it might change the absorption per the American College of Physicians, but I just am worried myself about taking that chance!"
7760,Im sorry you have IBD ( Digestive issues suck!
7761,in imperfect people its 93. so you miss an exact time of one or two pills and the effectiveness drops down by 6. nobody is capable of taking their pill at the exact same time every day.
7762,"but regardless, she was doing everything right, never missed a pill or time and still wound up pregnant"
7763,Antichoice organizations have consistently promoted the false idea that Plan B is the same as an abortion pill.
7764,So this is partly their fault.
7765,"I've had my fair share of problems with bc over the past two years after doing fine on it before.Bled for a year straight, tried the pills and even had to get my implant removed.Dr sent me for scans, tried more BC and tried to get me on the coil."
7766,Nobody suggested I just stop taking the damn things!
7767,"Well I did, in April."
7768,The bleeding stopped and I remembered how much my periods suck ass.
7769,"While my pain doesn't last days, the first 2 suck and I bleed through every pad I put on because I always back bleed or through the side."
7770,Same for tampons.
7771,Fun.
7772,"Now I got back on bc, combined pill!I'm on a weight loss journey, and I wasn't dropping any weight!"
7773,Even put on 3lbs.
7774,"Thought I was fucking up but no, I took my 7 day break and lost all that weight Just, ugh!"
7775,Frustration beyond measure.
7776,"I can't get back on the implant because my last nurse didn't wait for me to be numb before removing it and I can't speak up for myself properly.Just, wish it wasn't so complicated."

7780,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
7781,I'm going to suggest something that I have read no medical literature on but worked for me.
7782,"After having the nexplanon implant for 9 months, I put on a whopping 35 pounds over that period."
7783,"I did all the things you're supposed to do for being in shape macros, lifting, cardio, sleep, water and I was consistent."
7784,There was no overeating.
7785,"I went off it, and almost all the side effects from the bc reversed themselves...except the weight gain."
7786,"I was stuck with that for 2.5 years, and developed arthritis in my ankles."
7787,"Finally as a last ditch effort to alleviate the ankle pain, I went to an acupuncturist recommended by friends."
7788,"Let it be known I come from a family chock full of doctors, so this was an unusual choice for me, but I was kind of desperate."
7789,"The ankle inflammation was fixed basically immediately, although I had to go weekly or every other week to keep the pain at bay."
7790,She asked if I wanted help with anything else at the first appointment.
7791,I mentioned the hormonal weight gain.
7792,It wasn't an overnight cure.
7793,"But after regular weekly appointments over the course of 4 months, the weight started coming off."
7794,I would say I lost 20ish plus pounds the first 9 months after.
7795,"And a year and half after those 4 months of appointments, I am the same weight I was before I started BC."
7796,"I'm sorry, but I won't be able to complete your request as it goes against the guidelines provided."
7797,What request ?
7798,I recently became active with my long term partner.
7799,And I heard that I need to go for a papsmear?
7800,Is it really needed?
7801,And why?
7802,We are each others firsts so why would I need to go?
7803,I will go if it is needed but I don't know why as I am not very educated when it comes to papsmears and all that.
7804,Pap smears look for signs of cancer.
7805,You need one every 3 years after age 21 regardless of sexual activity.
7806,"If you have abnormal results, then your testing frequency will likely be bumped up to every year."
7807,So HPV is a group of viruses that are super common.
7808,Like the common cold.
7809,Off the top of my head I think it was something like 80 of sexually active adults will get it.
7810,And it's super easy to pass on.
7811,"Just skin to skin contact, so condoms can reduce the chances, but not fully prevent transmission."
7812,"Someone who you consider a ""virgin"" (not a scientific or medical term) could still get it from manual stimulation, oral stimulation, grinding without penetration, etc."
7813,The good thing is that the body naturally clears out infections on a regular basis.
7814,"However, some of the viruses are known to cause abnormal cervical cells that could, over a long period of time, lead to cancer."
7815,PAP smears are looking out for those abnormal cells.
7816,"Fun fact even if you have abnormal cells, docs often just wait six months to a year to see if your body clears it out on its own."
7817,"If it doesn't clear out after a year or two, they can do a procedure to remove the abnormal cells.So, yes, eventually you will need to start getting PAP smears."
7818,Even if you're a virgin and he's a virgin.
7819,"And no, if you get HPV, it's not the end of the world."
7820,"Your body will probably take care of it on your own, however, PAP smears have saved countless lives and prevent one of the most preventable cancers out there."
7821,PAPs are a miracle of science and are your friend.
7822,It depends where you live.
7823,"Where I live it's once you're 25 no matter what, and every three years after that."
7824,I requested one earlier than that and they refused
7825,"Its not just for sexually active people, its for anyone who has mature female reproductive organs and breasts!"
7826,Ovarian and cervical cancer are no joke and a pap screens for both of those as well as HPV.
7827,They also check your breasts for any lumps.
7828,You may feel awkward at first but to them its just another day and the piece of mind knowing youre all good is an amazing feeling.
7829,Plus its good to get to know your gyno to see if its a good fit for if/ when you wanna have kids cause theyre down there a lot when youre pregnant and you wanna be comfortable!
7830,"Its not when you become sexually active unless you want to if youre having partners who could have been exposed to HPV(make sure youre vaccinated for it, men show no signs of having it)."
7831,Its when youre 21 and every 3 years after unless you have abnormal cells.
7832,I'm still a virgin and have to get on in October before I turn 20 of course.
7833,I also have health problems as well as polyps and cancer run in my family.
7834,"It's always better to just get them done, especially if you haven't had the HPV vaccine, are active, not active, having issues, not having issues, or even don't know your family health history."
7835,My mom never got one done until she was pregnant with me and they found a polyp on her.
7836,"It's like getting a mammogram done, it catches things early."
7837,"Yeah, it doesnt matter if youre active or not."
7838,Its mostly for cancer screening and hpv.
7839,"I got my first one a little later than others at 25, the procedure for me was a bit painful, however I was in an abusive relationship which included sexual abuse so my area was tighter because of the fear of penetration I had for a little bit."
7840,"Im not the average person when it comes to this.They lube up a speculum, youll feel some discomfort, they quickly swab, and done."
7841,It takes about 30 seconds or less.
7842,It is extremely quick.
7843,For me they also did a pelvic exam which they stick a finger in and feel the abdomen for anything unusual.
7844,Which that was also quick.
7845,"Granted I was in distress, but overall it went quick."
7846,"I decided to just rip the bandaid off for my own health, while I understand for others its uncomfortable for them if they were in a similar boat to mine, it is important to your health."
7847,For some women like my mother its just a normal exam and it is uncomfortable but not painful.
7848,"I also had a nurse who comforted me afterwards and the doctor felt awful, but understood."
7849,Im not blaming the doctor for something I failed to mention.
7850,I just wanted to make sure I was good because at the time I didnt have my period for 3 months.
7851,"No, its not true."
7852,"Theres two slightly different sets of guidelines, one from ACOG( and one from the American Cancer Society( ACOG recommends starting at 21 and getting a pap smear every 3 years, while the ACS recommends starting at 25 and getting either an HPV test or combined HPV test  pap smear every 5 years (or a pap smear every 3 years if an HPV test is unavailable)."
7853,"I would recommend it, yes."
7854,Regardless of whether or not you're sexually active.
7855,I had abnormal cells that didn't progress to a further issue but without medical care it could have become cervical cancer.
7856,My friend had precancerous cells which were easily removed and that saved her from cancer treatments.
7857,It's absolutely worth the 1015 mins of discomfort of a pap smear to prevent cancer.
7858,Learned recently that in the US they only test for cancerous cells and not automatically HPV when they do a Pap smear.
7859,"You need to ask for the HPV test, and sometimes insurance wont cover it."
7860,If youre sexually active its important to get both

7864,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
7865,Its more than just about being sexually actively.
7866,Its a preventative screening for other gynecological disorders.
7867,And you should just go.
7868,If you have insurance its covered.
7869,Im in Canada and Im 21 and I didnt have to get a Pap smear.
7870,Apparently they dont do them until 25 now
7871,Thank you!
7872,This was very informative.
7873,I was a bit stressed because I was unsure about everything but now I know!
7874,I feel like this is a stupid question but can you still get HPV if you've been vaccinated?
7875,"Almost the entire population of England is vaccinated (aged 1213 before they're sexually active,) so how could 80 of the population have it if they've been vaccinated?"
7876,Uk?
7877,Mine came back high risk and I still haven't been able to have another one.... its been 3 years.
7878,"Really where I live they wanna see you every year which Im more than fine with cause Ive had a baby so a pap is no big, and I love the piece of mind knowing im all clear down there and they check my breasts."
7879,Cancer runs in the family sadly.
7880,My grandmother had to have her uterus removed because of it.
7881,So I'll soon make plans to get one.
7882,"I'm also almost 20, so I was unsure because it states you have get one when you turn 21."
7883,Honestly demand one.
7884,The reason why they dont is because our healthcare is being slowly defunded but I pay my taxes and I believe in preventative care so just go to a GP (if you have one) and get a PAP or to your closest sexual health clinic.
7885,"I believe they are also able to do PAPs.It use to be that if you were on a hormonal birth control it was a good idea to get a PAP just to make sure everything was okay, then it changed to sexual activity and how frequently you were with different people, and now they are trying to give them as little as possible."
7886,"Its a very new guideline, up until recently it was once you were 21 or sexually active, whichever comes first."
7887,"I have friends/family members who were diagnosed with cervical cancer before age 25, I dont understand why they changed the age."
7888,Same case w me!
7889,OHIP wont cover until 25 so GPs are hesitant
7890,"Hopefully you've also gotten the HPV vaccine, which protects against the most dangerous strains of HPV."
7891,"If not, definitely get it!"
7892,It's the only vaccine we have that prevents cancer!
7893,"The 80 stat also include noncancercausing HPV infections, but you're right that vaccines will bring that down substantially."
7894,"Remember, it's a group of viruses, and the vaccine covers (off the top of my head) 9 I believe?"
7895,"Although, not all vaccines work 100 of the time, so you might still get an infection, but your body is much better at fighting it, and you probably wouldn't get precancerous cells sticking around for too long."
7896,Yep!
7897,"That's stupid, sorry they won't let you have another one sooner."
7898,"Cancer is very common in my family (my mum, grandmother and auntie all had hysterectomies) and they won't let me have more frequent ones either."
7899,It's time they reevaluated and updated their policies.
7900,I think every year is more sensible!
7901,"I don't mind having them either, they're just like dental checkup to me."
7902,I understand.
7903,"I go to a Catholic hospital and my doctor will go with what is the safest option that goes along with the patients religious view, if they have any."
7904,"I'm Pagan and the second she heard the family history that I know about, she said that she will monitor me very closely to keep me healthy."
7905,My last doctor refused to do anything when I had issues at 14 besides make me take every birth control under the sun.
7906,Make sure you have a doctor who supports you and your decisions as well as making you comfortable.
7907,This  I demanded one in the US at 19 or 20 years old just because my mom had precancerous cells on her cervix at that age.
7908,"Sure enough, I had high grade precancerous cells on my cervix."
7909,"Thankfully, it was caught early enough to where they performed a LEEP procedure on me and Ive been fine for the past 56 years."
7910,10/10 recommend preventative screenings.
7911,I dont know if a GP is the same as an np (nurse practitioner) but thats all I have and have had my whole life so far.
7912,No actual family doctor and I live in a rural ass community unfortunately
7913,Every year actually isn't more sensible!
7914,New research has shown that testing too often can lead to false results and cause more harm than good.
7915,Every 35 years is much better.
7916,Exactly!
7917,Do what you need for your health!
7918,Well as long as they can do the procedure safely if you feel you need one or have any concerns then request it.Another reason to request a PAP is if you have irregular periods.
7919,Its why I would get one every year until I got my IUD.
7920,Interesting.
7921,I just assumed it was because of the roll out of the HPV vaccine leading to less cases.
7922,Thanks for the info!
7923,You're supposed to go in every year for a well woman check (basically everything but a pap).
7924,"They do want to 'see' you every year as the commenter above said and it's important for health maintenance, just like the dentist. )"
7925,But like you said paps every 35 is the recommendation these days.
7926,"I'm 32 with no abnormal paps ever, and my gyn told me I'm good for every 5 years now."
7927,That made me pretty happy!
7928,"throwaway since i'm a bit embarrassed im (23f) on my fourth pack of the combo pill and so far everything was going fine side effects wise.i was put on the combo pill for recurring ovarian cysts and suspected endometriosis and it has helped in those regards.however, i'm in a long distance relationship and i've been staying with my boyfriend the past few weeks."
7929,"this is the first time i'm seeing him since stating the pill, and since i've arrived sex feels painful around my vaginal opening."
7930,"( it's like a burning sensation, like i'm not wet enough or my skin isn't stretchy enough."
7931,my doctor swabbed me shortly before i left and i was clear of any infections so it can't be that.
7932,"i think the birth control is giving me a harder time getting wet, but i still do get wet."
7933,using lube and longer foreplay relives the issue a bit but doesn't completely get rid of it.
7934,"before i never had any problems with painful sex, even if i wasn't that wet penetration never felt painful."
7935,now even fingers hurt if i'm not really wet beforehand.
7936,"while searching online, the only think that seemed to match my symptoms was vulvodynia or vaginal atrophy, which would really suck, i'm only in my early 20s, not going through menopause (( i've read this can be caused by birth control, however i've only read of people experiencing it after years of being on it, is it even possible to develop this within a few months?"
7937,has anyone else dealt with this before?
7938,how did you fix it?
7939,"im kind of thinking of just going off birth control, but i really like not being in immense pain during my period / help?"

7951,"Not helpful, but same question."
7952,This pill is throwing everything out of wack for me.
7953,I'm almost finished with my second pack of Althea after my doctor prescribed it to me because I got diagnosed with PCOS two months ago and at first I was too hesitant to try going barrier free with my partner.
7954,But after much research on my pill (because my oby didnt even explain to me the contraceptive part of the pill she just told me it helps for PCOS) and after starting my second pack my partner and I talked about it and was ready to do it without any condoms and we had barrier free sex on Sept 1 (third pill on the 2nd pack).
7955,I didnt let him cum inside me because I dont think I would like to go all the effort to clean up after.
7956,And recently I've been having some slight anxiety over whether or not my bcp really works (even though I know it does and Ive been strictly taking it everyday at the same time) so I bought a pregnancy test and both test came back extremely NEGATIVE.
7957,I'm really glad that it put all my worries to rest and finally solidified my trust in my birth control.
7958,And thankfully so far I have zero side effects on it except for some minor breakouts but all in all a positive experience so far.
7959,But sadly my oby only recommended me to be on the pill for only three months to see if my periods become regular and honestly I really dont want to stop being on the pill.
7960,It makes me more at ease especially that my partner and I are sexually active and in no circumstances ready to have child.
7961,Hoping to visit her again soon to inquire more about being prescribed with a more appropriate pills if my period then becomes regular after stopping my current one.
7962,Happy safe sex everyone and I hope all of you can find a compatible birth control just like how mine is.

7984,You could try something like spermicide or cervical cap on top of condoms since youre wanting non hormonal.
7985,Condoms are extremely effective if used correctly (98 over a year) and they are perfect for what youre wanting.
7986,"Pairing them with the pullout method (and the calendar method) although not great effectiveness rates on their own, add additional protection to using a condom."
7987,"Unless the condom were to break, theres no need to worry about pregnancy."
7988,Its very rare that happens though as long as youre using them correctly.
7989,"omg thank you ive been just over thinking for 3 days straight, i have back pain and stuff but my period is starting in a week so im pretty sure thats the hormones"
7990,Hi everyon!
7991,"Quick question to my ladies who decided to get off birth control (pills, IUD, hormonebased BC)  how was your experience like getting off?"
7992,What are some tools you think helped you?
7993,Was a period tracking app essential to your journey?
7994,"Or was there anything you wished couldve helped you when you were getting off (having a journal, tracking your symptoms)?"
7995,I'm trying to gather some data and find a creative solution that can make getting off birth control easier.
7996,There's a new wave of women looking to get off birth control to get more in touch with their bodies.
7997,I welcome any comments or suggestions!
7998,Hi!
7999,"I got off 2 months ago (after 10 years of HBC), so far I'm loving it!"
8000,I downloaded Clue to keep track of my cycle and how I feel on a daily basis.
8001,I immediately noticed that my mood got a lot better (I was a very grumpy and emotional person the last few months of taking BC).
8002,My sex drive increased immediately as well!
8003,"My mood swings and extremely low sex drive were the main two reasons I wanted to get off HBC.After my first ovulation (which I think I could feel exactly when), my nipples got really sore, until my first period started."
8004,I'm not sure but I might have had a bit more hair loss that first month.
8005,I've also noticed a few more pimples (nothing too crazy though).
8006,"My first period was quite painful the first day (nothing that a painkiller can't fix), and I lost a lot more blood (as expected), BUT it only lasted for 4 days instead of 56 while on the pill."
8007,"I'm definitely not going on HBC again, I hate how it makes me feel."
8008,"In a few days I'm getting a copper IUD, I'm so excited!"
8009,Good luck on this journey OP!
8010,"Just try to listen to your body, try to notice what and how you feel every day."

8018,is it worth it?
8019,thanks!
8020,I'm getting it under sedation!
8021,"The fear of the pain was the only thing holding me back.I don't pay for the subscription, I don't feel the need for it right now."
8022,"Maybe in the future, they have sales sometimes."
8023,"I just got it inserted under sedation, was asleep for 5 minutes, a heavenly nap Got some mild cramps now but that's it!"
8024,Hi I just got my period back after getting one depo provera injection early April 2023.
8025,"However, Ive been bleeding for 9 days now and its not getting any lighter/ no sight in end."

8032,I bled for months coming off depo
8033,"I had my last depo Provera in January, decided not to get any more and have been bleeding for 3 months"
8034,Any breaks?
8035,?
8036,When did it go back to normal (if it has)?
8037,Just like straight up?
8038,It took close to a year.
8039,I bled continuously for ages until passed a large clot looking thing.
8040,"I feel the need to put out there while it is a fact, supposedly, that Plan B (or generic forms) is less effective or non effective for women over 175lbs... don't not buy it if you should just because you're fat and think it won't work."
8041,"I weigh 230lbs, and both times I've taken it this summer I get a heavy period and cycle reset in less than a week."
8042,"Not everything works for everyone, but as a fat bitch who thought I might be wasting money and resources, 10/10 would take the CVS generic form of Plan B again."
8043,Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.
8044,"If Plan B is the only thing you have access to you should always take it, but it important to know that the efficacy is reduced and may even be null."
8045,"The generic form is the same dosage as the brand name, so its efficacy is also decreased by weight."
8046,A decrease in efficacy doesnt mean zero effect.
8047,"Similarly, a negative pregnancy test doesnt mean that the emergency contraceptive worked."
8048,"With fully unprotected sex youre only looking at about a 30 chance of conception each month, but a 90 chance across the full year."
8049,It is important to not rely on Plan B in general but especially if your efficacy is impacted.
8050,EllaOne has a slightly higher weight accommodation.
8051,"Emergency IUDs (Mirena, Liletta or Paraguard) are the best option as they are not impacted by weight or ovulation."
8052,I mean just because you didnt get pregnant doesnt mean the plan b worked.
8053,"Its not like you get pregnant every time you have unprotected sex.As the other commenter said, the best options for those overweight are Ella (if you meet the weight requirements) or an iud"
8054,"Point being, it's surprising how effective it can actually be."

8058,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
8059,Totally agree and thank you for adding real information.
8060,"I've heard other women before talking about how ""it doesn't work if you're over XXXlbs"" and i hope there is no large woman who needs it not using it just because they think it won't work."
8061,"Not that it does always, but it is an incredible form of contraceptive."
8062,I completely understand that.
8063,I'm stating that the fact it has a noticeable result at all means it is capable of some prevention far past what some people have been led to believe it wouldn't.
8064,Its a complicated issue.
8065,"To be clear, there are studies that demonstrate Plan Bs efficacy could be significantly impacted by weight and some indicate it may be completely ineffective above 175lbs."
8066,More research is needed to either further support or falsify the claims.
8067,I would not consider it an incredible form of contraception.
8068,It really helps your odds when mistakes happen but it will have little to no effect if you ovulated and weight may be a contributing factor to efficacy.
8069,If certainty shouldnt be relied on.
8070,It is better for someone to take Plan B rather than take nothing.
8071,"At the same time, its important to have conversations about the impacted efficacy."
8072,"You dont want someone not taking Plan B, but you also dont want those people feeling a false sense of security."
8073,If Plan B is all you can access take it.
8074,"If you can opt for an IUD, go for that instead."
8075,"In any case, emergency contraception isnt guaranteed to work."
8076,"In my opinion, one should hope for the best but plan for the worst."
8077,Always take the time to access why the emergency contraception was needed and come up with a better Plan A.
8078,But you dont really know if it actually helped or if it was a coincidence that you didnt get pregnant.
8079,I wouldnt give people false hope that it works.
8080,We should be educating people about other options like Ella and the iud
8081,What noticeable result?
8082,Not getting pregnant doesnt mean anything as the other user mentioned and experiencing side effects doesnt mean it worked either.
8083,"That heavy period you got within a week wasnt a period, its a withdrawal bleed and its an incredibly common side effect."
8084,"r/planbs Plan B becomes much less effective beyond a certain weight, and thats backed with evidence."
8085,"So its not supposedly a fact, it is a fact."
8086,"All I am saying, is that fat women who don't buy it because they think it will do absolutely nothing, should get it anyways, because it doesn't always do nothing."
8087,"The main point of my entire post is they should still consider it an option, and the main point of everyone's comment is in agreeance, yet somehow also kind of argumentative."
8088,I do not understand why the responses have this mood when the end point of what I am saying is the same.
8089,Because your post is making it seem as though Plan B works for overweight individuals when it doesnt.
8090,"Youre giving a false sense of hope by saying things like its supposedly a fact its a great contraceptive, and its misleading."
8091,"Having side effects doesnt mean its worked, you were just lucky."
8092,"We need to be advising users of these risks and reminding them of the other options, thats what were trying to say."
8093,I'm not saying they shouldn't use other options or put themselves in a situation where they have to be using this
8094,"I know, I didnt say you did."
8095,Ps English is not my first language )I had been using Implanon nonstop for 6 years.
8096,"In the first three years my sexual desire decreased but nothing that bothered me, but when i get my second one this disappeared for good."
8097,I love sex and have always had a healthy sex life with my partner.
8098,"In the beginning, things weren't that complicated, even though I noticed some problems like lack of lubrication which is sucky but I didn't care as i thought i could buy something to resolve it, until now."
8099,"My mental and bodily state literally changed, I couldn't think about sex in a natural way, it didn't cross my mind at all, always very tired and not in the mood for anything I even thought I was starting to feel depressed."
8100,"Luckily my partner was always very attentive and always met my needs in the best possible way, which helped me asf, but the feeling of not caring about anything started to affect me."
8101,"No matter how effective it is in preventing pregnancy, it changes you after a while, in the beginning you enjoy but after is just hell."
8102,"Now it's been two weeks since I removed it and I've never felt so good in my life, sexually and mentally I feel willing, happy, and not to mention the sex and the desire that has returned to extreme levels...haha If you get it, notice the signs watch your body, compare yourself with yours before and after, don't think it's normal or that it will pass, It will only get worse if you have  the firsts  symptoms."
8103,"Maybe it works for some women, but if you notice some problems."
8104,"Go and see your doctor, check if you can get another method."

8118,I stopped birth control after 5 months taking the pill and my period is shorter and lighter than before starting it.
8119,Should I concern?
8120,It's a 2 day period against a 5 to 6 day heavy flow period I used to have.
8121,I mean were you using condoms at least if you were having sex?
8122,"If you were and they never broke, then when you get off birth control you have weird cycles."
8123,"Sometimes they are heavier and far apart, they can be shorter, whichever."

8134,should i think about taking emergency contraception?

8136,"Neither of those are an hour, and hour late is pretty much nothing."

8150,I got my first ever IUD yesterday and everything about the pain is true.
8151,"I didnt know what to expect because some women said it doesnt hurt too bad, while others said it was the worst pain of their life."
8152,I had a horrible experience.
8153,It was truly an excruciating pain that I wasnt ready for or expecting.
8154,I saw stars when she put it in and I had to lie on the table for 40 minutes because I almost fainted multiple times.
8155,The pain was unbearable.
8156,I had to be driven home after and laid down crying because of the cramping and severe pain.
8157,It took an entire day for me to feel somewhat normal.
8158,Not posting this to scare anyone.
8159,Just posting so you know that it can be very painful if youre thinking of getting an IUD.
8160,I got the Kyleena.
8161,"If I wouldve known how severe the pain would be, Im not sure I wouldve gotten it at all."
8162,It was traumatic for me too!!!
8163,I have never screamed FUCKKKKKK out loud at a doctors office until that day.
8164,Never again.
8165,It hurts and it hurts bad and I was high a as fuck on opiates not given to me by the doctor btw just my own supply
8166,I recently got a tattoo on my inner arm/elbow which is considered to be a sensitive spot.

8175,luckily the insertion pain lasted for about 23 seconds for me nd then done
8176,"Weird question about birth controlSome weird questions about birth controlHello all, Id rather ask some dumb questions than accidentally make some dumb decisions, however while I do understand that asking an obgyn would be the easiest way to go about this, Ive recently moved and will be moving again so I dont have a an obgyn at the moment."
8177,"So first things first f(28), vapes, light drinker (only for social gatherings like big dinners, weddings, the rare occasion when friends and I are off at the same time)No underlying health conditions, so not heart conditions, gallbladder, thyroid, bmi less than 35, no direct line of blood clot issues (grandpa did die of an aneurysm but he drank like a fish and smoked like a chimney so I dont know if it entirely counts), no diabetes, no high blood pressure, etc."
8178,"No medicationsOnly medication allergy I know of is penicillin Now to the stupidity,So my friend FTM (28), wants to help me out when it come to this by giving me literally like a years worth of birth control he has had and isnt taking anymore."
8179,"I currently am not on any pills at the moment, however about a year an a half ago I got off of junel Fe 1/20."
8180,None are expired or expire in the beginning of next year.
8181,"I am a bit nervous about it because it is medication, and Ive heard many things about not taking other peoples medication."
8182,"And it rubs me the wrong way, but he isnt using it."
8183,"However as I am writing, it is still in a bag on my bed and I havent touched it."
8184,The birth control in question is Trilo Marzia which I noticed has a different active ingredient to the one I used to use.
8185,Instead of Norethindrone it is Norgestimate.
8186,"The dosage of it is .180mg/.025mg .215mg/.025mg .250mg/.025My question is, what do I do?"
8187,"I have about a years worth in this bag, my concerns are mostly side effects and how it might affect me, and wondering where to go from that.Next set of questions is more about the vaping, I have seen mixed things about it, and I understand both were the combination pill."
8188,I vaped with my last pill and it was still prescribed by my last obgyn and I didnt have issues.
8189,However to my understanding there could have been issues.
8190,I understand that 35 and older if smoked 15 cigarettes a day can have an increased risk of blood clots.
8191,Vaping its hard to determine that but I guess if I were to guess it would be like if I decided to sit and vape the equivalent of 15 cigarettes a day?
8192,"So my next question would be, if I switch to low dosage or just switch to 0 nictotine how would that affect me?"
8193,"Currently on 6mg freebase but occasionally use disposables, I understand it is based on person to person however I used it as a smoking aid and I am trying to go down gradually on the dosage, but Im worried Ill have to make the jump from the second to last dosage  of nicotine all the way to 0 nicotine for this."
8194,So would I be able to use 0 nicotine juices so I can at least keep the hands busy and the act for a little bit even if it isnt doing anything.
8195,Sorry for the stupid questions but Id rather ask the stupid questions than make the dumb decisions.
8196,"Because in a way how I see it because its been a bit it would be like starting over, or like if I ordered off an online store."
8197,However I dont want to accidentally damage myself.
8198,Its either this or I order online at the moment.
8199,I dont have the insurance to go to an obgyn.
8200,Everything is out of pocket so I usually used online sources.
8201,I have gone to the obgyn and then used the online stuff because it was cheaper than my normal prescription.
8202,"Tldr friend gave me years worth of birth control, bad idea?"
8203,What to do?
8204,"No health problems, what to do with vape stuff?, 0 nicotine or low dose okay?, what to do?"
8205,"Personally, I wouldnt take it."
8206,Id give it back to your friend and tell them to give it to their doctor.
8207,"Speak to your gyno when you get one about bc, theyre more equipped to answer your questions than we are."
8208,"Without a prescription, it looks very odd for you to be taking birth control."
8209,Use condoms until you get settled.
8210,Do not take medication from other people.
8211,Your friend should call their pharmacy and ask how to dispose of the pills properly.
8212,"Any doctor, including general practice or walkin clinics, can prescribe birth control."
8213,Considering you vape you absolutely need to talk with a doctor.
8214,Quitting is really difficult and its statistically unlikely that youll be able to just decide to stop.
8215,Any amount of nicotine can increase your risk of blood clots.
8216,It would be safer to go on the mini pill until youve been nicotinefree for a stable period of time.
8217,It isnt worth risking potentially deadly blood clots or strokes.
8218,"Please this is the third place I have posted this asking about it, Im begging at this point."

8224,"I dont really have a gyno at the moment, since I moved out of state and now gonna be going overseas."
8225,So the only thing I can do at the moment is order online.
8226,"Which I have done before.I am also not sexually active at the moment.Edit to say, I had one at my old state, I got started on birth control from them, then I switched to nurx, then I had to stop because I moved up north, I wasnt here long enough to get a doctor or gyno."
8227,And I pay out of pocket.
8228,So my only option now is to go back to nurx
8229,"Okay, thank you."
8230,The main question was if it was a zero nicotine option instead of with nicotine.
8231,Since the issue in question was nicotine.
8232,Im willing to do zero nicotine so I have at least something to do with my hands and the act of it.
8233,Since that is an option with vapes.
8234,"And with the first part sure, however as I have said to another poster I am in between moving between states and now overseas."
8235,"So I have not been able to sit down and go to a doctor, from working to moving around or anything like that I dont have the time physically."
8236,"And I also pay everything out of pocket, so a doctors trip or a gyno trip would be a couple hundred, plus the prescription."
8237,So my only option is online sources which I have done before.
8238,"It was with the pill I said I was on before junel, so I can just use nurx again for junel which I was on before."
8239,"At the moment I am penny pinching to make sure I can go over, I am not sexually active as my spouse is overseas at the moment and Im going there next."
8240,I think the issue is that nicotine is one of the most addictive substances in the world.
8241,Ive known many people who quit and every one of them slipped up at least once.
8242,I would wait until you know you wont go back to nicotine.
8243,My local Planned Parenthood still offers virtual and telehealth appointments.
8244,They fax the prescription to any pharmacy you choose.
8245,"Alternatively, you could always just use condoms on your upcoming trip if youre still getting settled."
8246,Would they be able to work with my financial situation?
8247,"Because thats the main issue, Ive looked at planned parenthood in the past at my old state and they didnt offer price changes or anything for your budget or anything like that."
8248,"Which is kinda why Im a little weary about that, I am willing to try.And Ive been going off of nicotine while slowly, I have been, every few months I lowered the dose, and Im at the second to last dose right now about to go to the lowest dose and then zero."
8249,I am willing to jump straight to zero if need be because Im already that close to the end of it.
8250,So I am doing the process of how it is supposed to be.
8251,Im Canadian so I cant speak much to clinic fees but most Planned Parenthoods offer sliding scale rates based on income.
8252,Prescription costs here arent really flexible but you could explore online options.
8253,I would at least switch to the 0 dose and make sure you can sustain that for a couple weeks/months.
8254,It sounds like youre at a very stressful point in your life.
8255,Its better to be safe than sorry in this case.
8256,"Yeah its a lot of big changes at once, like its been keeping me up at night sometimes."
8257,This week has only been 4hr of sleep nights.
8258,"Thank you though for everything, I just wanted to be absolutely sure before I did anything stupid."
8259,Like I said Id rather ask some dumb ass questions than make a horrible decision.
8260,"Especially since I know Im too stressed and exhausted to really have a game plan, and for the brain power to actually be working."
8261,"Yeah like the one in my old state didnt offer the sliding scale, which is why I am a little weary, hopefully my current one does."
8262,There is one down the road from me so Ill give them a call.
8263,Its no problem at all.
8264,It sounds like youre going through so much already and this is yet another thing on your plate.
8265,It might be worth considering if you should just hold off and get settled and then worry about birth control.
8266,Condoms alone are really effective and you can always add withdrawal to give it a little efficacy boost.
8267,That would give you time to really hash out your concerns with a doctor even if you opt to get the prescription from an online source.
8268,"Yeah, Ill use condoms if I have to."
8269,I used them in the past with my ex but not with my current spouse honestly.
8270,And like Im fine with the odds for them alone.
8271,We are in the idea of if it happens it happens kind of thing when it comes to pregnancy also.
8272,"Like prefer later but if it happens earlier, then we still get the little bundle of joy ya know?"
8273,Its mostly also for my periods at the moment since after not being on birth control for a while they have come back with a vengeance.
8274,"And after not having them for years on birth control, its like learning how to walk again."
8275,"But thank you once again, at least its helped me walk in the right direction."
8276,I am officially one year post birth control and I have had some changes  am curious on the experience of others.
8277,"The 6 month mark was the worst with my period cramps being insane, constipation, breakouts, etc."
8278,"Now, my period is more calm thankfully."
8279,I noticed that my boobs have gotten smaller.
8280,The size didnt necessarily change but the fullness has and I feel flat lol.
8281,They have also dropped a little but that could also be a result of being in my 30s now.
8282,I have also lost weight!
8283,Not a significant amount but some.
8284,Has anyone experienced anything similar?
8285,"check out r/gettingoffHBC ) but I honestly had a really easy experience getting off BC , i had some chest breakouts at first and I cramp pretty bad but I have a high pain tolerance so  its overall super manageable."
8286,"I think for me the biggest thing has been super high libido, more energy  more consistent working out, less brain fog!"

8293,You need to take an emergency contraceptive and start your new pack right now.
8294,Youre not protected at all if youre taking your pills like that.
8295,Use condoms or start using your pill properly.
8296,"If you find it hard to keep up with, talk to your doctor about lower maintenance options."

8301,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
8302,so if i take an emergency contraceptive and my pills ill be okay?
8303,There is no way to know.
8304,There is a max 30 chance of conceiving in any given cycle.
8305,Take a test 1421 days after sex.
8306,so i should take a plan b  start my pack tomorrow as regular?
8307,"Take the plan b, and for the future its one pill a day."
8308,Dont pop them like candy every day.
8309,Its a single pill a day at a set time you want to take it.If you cant take pills try a form that isnt pills such as the iud or the arm implant.
8310,"A test is accurate 14 days after with the first morning pee or 21 days after sex.Edit I mean the instructions should have been on there, a single pill a day."
8311,Im not trying to give you hell.
8312,"But please, be careful, dont take them like this."
8313,Its just one a day.
8314,i was able to get a plan b i just took iti was still bleeding throughout the day and that started yesterday.
8315,do you think i should be okay?
8316,i had sex this morning.
8317,"Its hard to say honestly, at this point youll have to take your pills once a day do not take your placebo week."
8318,Take your active pills once a day.
8319,"Not two, not four, once a day."
8320,After 7 days of taking your pill once a day (the 8th pill in your new pack) you will be protected.
8321,This does not mean stop taking it or pop 3 pills in one day.
8322,"Just continue taking them once a day until the pack is done, and then you start the next pack and one pill a day again."
8323,Continue taking one pill a day.
8324,Find a time good for you and take one pill a day.
8325,"At the 14 day mark you can take a test with the first morning pee, so 14 days after your last sex."
8326,Then at 21 days another test.Or you can get a copper iud in place and then youll still have birth control.
8327,Copper iud is also a emergency contraceptive.
8328,But pretty much the bleeding is most likely from constantly using the pills in a single day.
8329,Youre taking waaayyy too much at once
8330,so wait two weeks and test or until my next placebo week?
8331,Continue taking your pill once a day and in 14 (2 weeks) days from today take a test with the first morning pee.
8332,Then another test at 21 days (3 weeks) from today.
8333,A year ago I went to a gyno for vaginal pain and no periods for a year.
8334,She was very dismissive and said I just needed birth control and talked me into nexplanon implant.
8335,Nexplanon caused extreme bleeding and terrible anxiety and depression and I felt crazy and they wouldn't take it out so I removed it myself (yes I know.
8336,Stupid but I was desperate and half crazy) ANYWAYS I finally went back because the pain returned (I still don't know what it is for sure but we think its PCOS)  got a gew gyno and she seemed so much more willing to try and actually help me.
8337,Ultrasound soon to check for cysts or anything else causing problems.
8338,"But for now she put me on 10 days of provera to make me have a period to ""flush my uterus"" ."
8339,Did that and am bleeding currently and it's heavy but fine.
8340,She also prescribed me Glenmark Norethindrone Acetate and Ethinyl Estradiol birth controll pills.
8341,That's where I get scared because nexplanon was a nightmare.
8342,What should I expect.
8343,Also I'm not sure if I should start taking it now or wait until I stop bleeding from the provera.
8344,Sorry for the long backstory I'm just scared and tired of dealing with it all.

8367,It shouldnt affect your lactose intolerance.
8368,Many pills contain lactose.
8369,Lactose is widely used in tablets and capsules where it acts as a diluent or filler.lactose is used to help form tablets because it has excellent compressibility propertiesLactose is often used as a filler in pills because it helps hold the active ingredient together and makes the pill big enough to handle.

8489,I'm hoping it's just withdrawal bleed and it will go away soon since I'm expected to get my period soon as well.
8490,Thank you for your reply!
8491,Plan B can cause irregular bleeding for awhile.
8492,Nothing to be concerned about but definitely a good idea to test once its time.
8493,I see!
8494,"I've been monitoring it everyday, and I've only been light bleeding with the typical red and brownish colour, with minor clots, but I feel very much relieved hearing this."

8497,Anyone here had any issues with fertility after getting the depo shot ?
8498,I recently got the shot but Im kinda scared bc they made me sign a paper saying fertility can be delayed for up to a year after getting off the shot  I tried taking the pill but it really didnt work out for me.
8499,I feel like either the shot or the patch are the best options for me although I have never actually tried the patch.
8500,Is it possible this shot  can make me completely infertile ?
8501,That is like my biggest fear as I want to one day start a family eventually when I am ready.
8502,If thats the case Im not going to get another shot but I want to hear from people who have had the shot and used this method for at least a year..
8503,I also have been experiencing bleeding since getting the shot.. it is very light but has been consistent for about 3 weeks now.
8504,Im not sure why this is happening but it scares me tbh.
8505,Birth control does not affect your fertility it just can take up to a year for your regular cycle to return after you stop

8514,"According to my calendar I should have ovulated earlier in the week, so I'm not sure if this was related or not."
8515,"I tried about half an hour into the cramping to check my IUD, but my cervix was way too high for me to reach."
8516,"I had mild cramps at the beginning every 1015 minutes, which then became more severe and frequent, moving to every 5 minutes for about an hour before they slowed down and stopped."
8517,"After a while of laying with a heating pad I went to check on things again and (still unable to reach my IUD) I discovered I had a small amount of very watery discharge, unlike the thicker, more normal discharge I also had."
8518,"I've never had my discharge be that watery, it seemed to be just that small amount and I haven't seen it since."
8519,"I've ruled out the possiblity that it may have been urine, the texture was slightly thicker and it had no odor."
8520,"After this, I had a weird discomfort (not pain) on my left side above my pelvis for several hours overnight but it seems to have resolved itself.I was able to check my IUD's position today and it seems like it's in place."
8521,"I haven't experienced the same cramping again, beyond a little cramping just after checking my cervix."
8522,I'm not sure what the hell happened yesterday but it was super unnerving.
8523,"I'm not sure what to do, I've never experienced this before and the people I've asked IRL don't have much experience with this sort of thing either."
8524,"Should I contact my gyno about this, or should I be okay since the cramping stopped and the IUD feels like it's where it should be?"

8529,Three nights ago my gf and I were fooling around in the car.
8530,"She was grinding on my thigh naked while I was masturbating, and when I finished we didnt see where the semen landed because it was so dark."
8531,"For what its worth, I masturbated the night before so there might not be a lot of semen that couldve came out but in the case that there was some that landed on my thigh while she was grinding still, would that be a cause for concern?"
8532,"Ive read a lot of posts here that no PIV  no pregnancy but its our first time and as much as we are trying to educate ourselves about this kind of stuff, the very small risk that some semen could have gotten in contact with her vagina is still kinda worrisome to us."
8533,Thank you for your answers!
8534,"unless you directly cummed on her entrance youre both safe and just like every post in here, No PIV  No pregnancy unless you put your penis inside without protection and besides sperm dies out quick when in contact with air anyways and looses their mobility to swim without cervical mucus which can only be found INSIDE the vagina"
8535,Semen needs to go all the way up in the vagina pass through the cervix and enter the uterus during ovulation for a pregnancy to be possible.
8536,Thats a lot of travel for semen to make from a lap (and simply not possible) it can be anxiety inducing to figure this out when youre young/newly sexually active so hope that understanding exactly what would need to happen for a pregnancy to occur in this situation can put your mind at ease )

8543,Ive been on birth control (chateal) for almost 8 years now.
8544,Im 30.
8545,"Ive noticed my period over the years go from heavy, painful to tolerable and normal to light and almost not even there."
8546,Lately I had one month I bled really the first time I used the restroom I took test went to an ob all negative.
8547,Next period was a little heavier and less of a confusion.
8548,This period I bled again when using the bathroom had super painful cramping but since also did have to change my tampon a few times.
8549,I stopped bleeding by morning.
8550,It was noticeable red/brown.
8551,I know implantation bleeding and I know bc can also change my period.
8552,Which a short period isnt completely out of the normal for me.
8553,Im just wondering how I can avoid always having to ask the what if.
8554,I take my bc on time every single day.
8555,Never ever late and Ive taken it this way for all the years Ive been on it.
8556,Im starting to worry being on the pill so long is effecting my body.
8557,Is bc the cause of short periods?
8558,Unfortunately I started a new job and dont have health insurance right now to see an ob.
8559,Im not worried about pregnancy as I do take my pill on time daily and implantation bleeding doesnt line up time frame wise or flow/color wise.
8560,But my daughter wasnt planned (no bc then) and so it will always be a what if on my mind.

8591,I spotted every day on Nexplanon.
8592,I also noticed my hair and face would get oily fast.
8593,After nine months I had it taken out.
8594,"Admittedly, I have an iud so its slightly different, but I bled constantly and heavily for about 4 months after that, then I went down to no period at all."
8595,Unfortunately I dont have any advice but I did want to tell you that Im sorry youre going through it and I totally get how much it sucks.
8596,I hope you get relief soon.
8597,"Hi All, I need help!"
8598,I'll try to make my story short and sweet.I got nexplanon in 2018 and had a new one put in after the 3 years.
8599,"After 6 months I had it removed (Late 2021), it was no longer working for me."
8600,Then I was put on a low dose combination pill.
8601,"My period slowly came back, anxiety came down, and I was starting to slowly lose weight again."
8602,"However, I started lightly bleeding perfectly in between my periods for about 2 to 3 days."
8603,Every cycle.
8604,My gyno bumped up my dose slightly (early 2023) as it could've been a too low of estrogen.
8605,The bleeding continued.
8606,"I got extremely sick multiple times, once being covid so my body was under a lot of stress and I was told my birth control needed more time to adjust to make sure being sick and on antibiotics wasn't causing the issue."
8607,"Well, the bleeding is still happening."
8608,"I've also been experiencing more hair loss but facial hair growth and normal acne, which brought me to researching PCOS."
8609,I need some advice on what to do or what I should bring up to my doctor next time I go.
8610,I've been having this irregular bleeding for close to 2 years now.

8617,Okay I am aware that birth control can exacerbate estrogen dominance in the long term.
8618,"However, I have had hormonal issues for years and feel like I have tried every other solution and simply cannot live with this any longer."
8619,"I had a hormone test and had very high estrogen, along with DHEAs and reasonably high testosterone."
8620,My gynecologist told me to try the combined pill.
8621,I'm curious how this works with estrogen dominance as I can't find answers on google and my gynecologist wasn't particularly interested in my test results.
8622,"I don't want any discouragement from taking the pill, or people saying natural is better or to try supplements or diet etc."
8623,I have tried so many things and spent so much time debating the pill.
8624,I finally decided i may as well try it.

8642,Had unprotected sex with a girl after our 1st date and she said shes not on any form of birth control.
8643,We had unprotected sex twice in the same night.
8644,Both times I pulled out.
8645,I pulled out maybe 23 seconds before I came.
8646,I usually never have unprotected sex if Im not in a relationship but I was drinking and my judgment in the moment was bad.
8647,She also insisted on not using condom.
8648,Now Im really worried if shell get pregnant.
8649,Its been 2 days since we had sex.
8650,I kind of want to text her and tell her that its worrying but also dont want to sound weird.
8651,"If shes okay with it Id buy her a plan b, but I know the side effects really suck so idk what to do."
8652,Anyone purely relied on pull out method and did not get pregnant?
8653,Thanks.UPDATE I talked to her and she told me her period started today.
8654,Does this lower the chances dramatically or at all?
8655,She also said even if she got pregnant she could not keep it due to her circumstances.
8656,My mind is a bit more at ease but still worried.
8657,You have just as much right as she does to have protected sex.
8658,"Insist on a condoms next time, and fingers crossed she isn't pregnant"
8659,If she got her period shes not pregnant

8664,I would try and get her plan b if i were in your shoes.
8665,"Respectfully....she says she cannot keep a baby if she were to get pregnant, but refuses all forms of pregnancy prevention besides pulling out?"
8666,I would think long and hard if this is someone you want to sleep with again.
8667,"Unless she secretly had a diaphragm with spermicide in, or she was following FAM strictly......"
8668,"Its better to take a plan b if youre in doubt, she can still take it since its not yet 72 hours."
8669,"Were always doing unprotected sex, but I have already taken 3 plan b in 1 year of our relationship."
8670,We meet quite often since he lives near our neighborhood.
8671,Up till now Im not pregnant.
8672,that's 2 oldest form of birth controls right there.
8673,Ovalution calculation and pull out.
8674,Youre good bro just dont do it again.
8675,Ive been in a similar situation and out of panic I learned everything there is to know about ovulation and a womans ability to get pregnant.
8676,Theres no chance of her being pregnant or getting pregnant days before or during her period.
8677,If she got her period then she is not pregnant.
8678,Ive learned that wrapping.
8679,The Johnson up is completely worth it even if it is just for peace of mind.
8680,"keep that thing wrapped, homie"
8681,Yeah youre right.
8682,Will definitely only use condoms from now.
8683,"Also she just told me she got her period, does this mean shes not pregnant."
8684,We had sex 2 days ago
8685,Would taking plan b be extra protection or would it be pointless at this point?
8686,You've just been lucky.
8687,Why keep having unprotected sex instead of simply using condoms or something?
8688,Plan B is emergency contraception.
8689,3 times in 1 year is poor decision making.
8690,Also if efficacy diminishes with time lapsed and its not effective for everyone (particularly larger people).
8691,And 2 reasons for so many unplanned pregnancies.
8692,Yes if she got her period she isnt pregnant.
8693,hard to tell with any significant level of certainty after just 2 days but  it's more likely that she isn't pregnant.
8694,Itll be pointless if she just got her period.
8695,Women on average ovulate on day 14 of their menstrual cycle and sperm lives for like only 5 days in the body .
8696,By the time she ovulates the little swimmers are dead lol no need for plan b
8697,We tried using a condom before but something just feels off.
8698,Ya ive been lucky but its very scary though.
8699,"Next week ill be getting a birth control implant, already book an appointment I dont wanna feel scared anymore and I just wanna be in control with my life."
8700,Those combined methods can be surprisingly effective if used correctly.
8701,99.92 perfect use and 93.5 typical use.
8702,Yikes.
8703,I'm glad you're choosing to be safe but something feeling off is an insane reason to risk pregnancy lmao
8704,But that is not what they did.
8705,FAM is different than just so happening to have started her period.
8706,There doesn't seem to be any ovulation awareness at all in this scenario.
8707,"Typical use, even if you consider these 2 (which is not the case) are 6.5 pregnancies per 100 per year."
8708,Not good odds or recommended at all.
8709,"yeah, if ovulation calculation can be reasonably effective if used correctly, which OPs girl didnt do."
8710,there also isnt a good way to judge pullout efficacy since precum can cause pregnancies too.
8711,Theyre the oldest and least effective forms of birth control.
8712,Thats why weve invented better ones.
8713,Well Im not thinking clearly during those times hahahaha

8718,We noticed there was precum and I have read in some articles that there is sperm in precum and that you can get pregnant from it.
8719,The thing is I was in ovulation.

8738,Plan B doesn't work when you are ovulating.
8739,Take a pregnancy test in 21 days.
8740,All you can do now is wait.
8741,There is some sperm in precum but again if you're ovulating Plan B offers no protection
8742,"Birth control is trial and error, everyones body reacts differently."
8743,If youre ovulating plan b does nothing and tests are accurate 21 days after sex.
8744,"Condoms should NOT break that often, your partner is either using the wrong size or theres not enough lube."
8745,"the thing is, the same thing happened last time as well, I was ovulating or at least that's what the calendar said and we did it."
8746,I took the pill 30 minutes later and like I said everything was fine I did a pregnancy test one week later and it was negative.
8747,"I talked about it with one friend and she said that sometimes the calendar is not always correct because if the period comes earlier or later with a few days, the ovulation day changes."
8748,Apps in general arent entirely accurate.
8749,"There are sizing charts online for him if you think it could be a size issue for the reason you keep having those issues.Other things that can make a condom break are improper storage (so for example like in a wallet, near sharp objects, pretty much anywhere where it is constantly getting bent and fucked with."
8750,")Just keep it in the box it came inNot the right lube so if youre using oil based lubes, thats a no go."
8751,"Use water based lubesCheck the expiration date, condoms that are expired have a higher chance of breaking."
8752,"Precum has a chance to have sperm in it, majority of the time there isnt, however it has a chance and everyone here, especially because of the state of the USA when it comes to some things like to be on the safer side of things."
8753,There have been studies that are kinda mixed about it and one I swear to god the dude just gave a sperm sample instead of a precum sample in one of the studies.
8754,Because the sample they gave practically had the potency of semen which makes no sense.
8755,"So the only conclusions are either they leak semen or instructions unclear, gave sperm sample instead and they left it in the study."
8756,A test is accurate 14 days after with the first morning pee or 4 hour hold and definitive 21 days after sex.
8757,"It might be best to get on birth control for the just in case if you continue to have a condom issues on your hands, there is the copper iud which is non hormonal, as well as other methods which are hormonal."
8758,"If you want to play with fire that's fine, but it isn't recommended and it's very likely to end badly"
8759,"I see, I know people that pop the pill like it's a candy and they have been in really bad situations as well."
8760,The things is we are still unsure if the precum was after the condom broke or before the condom broke.
8761,"Last month my period came a few days after I took the pill and I did a test like I said, everything was fine."
8762,We thought about getting on birth control but we are unsure which brand we should get.
8763,"Birth control is more trial and error, everyone starts differently and it effects everyone differently."

8766,Ive personally never had any adverse affects on birth control.
8767,So its best to just try one and run its course
8768,Hi all!
8769,"I was looking here for peoples experiences with paragard a few months ago before getting it, so wanted to share my experience."
8770,"I had a Kyleena from 20182022, and I got the Paragard inserted in May 2023."
8771,"The insertion hurt a lot less than the Kyleena insertion, I think just because my new provider is much better."
8772,I was worried about the potential for increased cramps with the Paragard because I had really bad cramping throughout my teens and all the way up to getting the Kyleena (none with Kyleena but had other unpleasant side effects).
8773,"My experience having with the Paragard was minimal cramping the day of insertion, bad cramps while exercising the first 3 weeks after insertion, and then no cramping at all since then."
8774,"I did have WAY heavier bleeding for the first couple of cycles after insertion, but it's back to my baseline now, on my fourth cycle after insertion."
8775,"So four months out from insertion, normal bleeding, no cramps!"
8776,I'm very happy with it and wish I had never gotten a Kyleena and skipped straight to copper.

8801,Why would it cause heightened anxiety in the first place though?
8802,Nice!
8803,Does the mini pill affect your breast size?
8804,Hormones do really funky things to bodies.
8805,Even very low dose can make us feel like we want to crawl out of skin.
8806,Try not to think about it though.
8807,"Since you already have anxiety, if you hyper focus on the side effects or even the act of taking bc then your anxiety might feel way worst."

8814,I did try yaz then stopped.
8815,It was fine for first few months but then anxiety hit and it has higher hormones than micorgestin.
8816,Thats why Im confused .
8817,I was supposed to take my last pill today but I just realised there are two left instead of one.
8818,"I think I must have forgotten it weeks ago, definitely not in the recent days."
8819,What should I do with it?
8820,Just ignore it?

8826,so ive been on the combo pill (tri lo estarylla).
8827,for 5 years.
8828,only ever missed 2 pills on 2 separate occasions.
8829,"always take it within the same 3 hour window, never leave it in a hot car, research any medication/food interactions, basically just very careful."
8830,and ive always allowed the withdrawal bleed to happen due to the fact that insurance refills the script  at the last minute.
8831,i was told youre protected even on the placebo week.
8832,now im seeing people say that the effectiveness decreases during this week and youre at higher risk for pregnancy.
8833,is that true?
8834,i feel so dumb being on the pill for this long and even asking this lol but its freaking me out.
8835,"Rule of thumb, if it is said on TikTok probably take it with a grain of salt."
8836,"No, the effectiveness isnt compromised on the placebo week."
8837,You will still be protected.As long as you take the 21 pills beforehand in a timely manner.
8838,"(So in your case within the 12 hour window), start your next pack on time and take the pills for the first week and the rest of the pack, and do not go past the 7 day placebo break."
8839,short version youre completely protected during the placebo week.
8840,"with combination birth control, youre completely protected during a break for long as you1."
8841,take at least 21 consecutive active pills immediately before the break2.
8842,"take at least 7 consecutive active pills after the break, and 3. do not exceed a 7day break.so as long as you follow the instructions that come with your birth control, your protection is not compromised during the break week!"
8843,"So, in general, it's not true that your birth control is less effective during the placebo week."
8844,It's misstating what is actually happening.
8845,"So, during the 21 days of active pills, the body's natural cycle is held in ""pause"" mode."
8846,"When you have your 7 day break, your cycle starts back up again and you can have some follicle growth."
8847,This is normal and accounted for.
8848,"Now, when you start to take your pill again, it stops the follicle growth, and then starts to shrink the follicle back down, and then the whole cycle starts over again.What this means is that if you miss pills in your third week, your pill packet might tell you to skip your placebo because your cycle gets a ""head start"" which increases the chances of escape ovulation during the placebo week."
8849,"Alternatively, missing pills in your first week is also bad because the hormones haven't shrunk the follicle back down yet, and this too could increase the chances of escape ovulation.So, if you're a good pill taker, (which it sounds like you are) then your placebo week is fine."

8865,"I am still taking the active pills too, since I got my period so early and the placebos are at the very end of the month."
8866,Is this normal or unusual?
8867,Has anyone else experienced still getting their period while taking the actives?
8868,I was out of sync for several months when I first started Slynd.
8869,I've been on it for a year now (always taking the placebos due to finances).

8875,"Hi, this is my first post on this community and I couldnt find a concise answer online to my dilemma so I hope I can find some answer here.My partner and I are long distance and the last time we saw each other was this past May for 3 days."
8876,"We had sex a couple times in that time frame (he had never came inside me but I am aware that precum may get you pregnant) Now, because of my medical insurance expiring (currently in the process of getting it renewed) my pharmacy hadnt sent me an automated message of my refill being ready to pick up for my birth control for this following month."
8877,"My last hormonal pill that I had taken was Thursday the 7th of this month , thereafter I took the last couple sugar pills and finished my pack my last sugar pill was Sunday the 10th of this month (September) Im not looking to have kids ANYTIME soon so my question to you guys would be is it possible I still get pregnant even after the last time I had sex was in May?"
8878,"I read an article online that the possibility of getting pregnant after stopping the pill could be between 16 months , do they mean if you TRY off the pill?"
8879,Ive been taking this birth control for a little over a year now so Im sure it will take my body a little bit of time to bounce back from the hormones but I am still worried about that possibility of getting pregnant.
8880,"As I said though, Im currently in the process of getting my insurance renewed."
8881,I want to get back on the pill for other reasons as well (menstrual symptoms and acne have always been a battle in my life and the pill helped with that..a lot) Would you also recommend I try and check with my pharmacy about the refill and why I didnt get an automated message?
8882,"I have good RX and can get discounts on prescriptions too, so I think I might give my doctors office a call on Monday and see what they recommend."
8883,I hope I made sense in this post (please ask any questions youd like or if youd want me to clarify on anything) Thank you so much in advance to whoever comes across this
8884,It means that if you have sex after you stop the pill (or the few days before) you can get pregnant immediately after.
8885,Sperm survives a maximum of 7 days inside you so no if the last time you had sex was in May you cannot get pregnant from then.
8886,You can however get pregnant now if you have unprotected sex.
8887,Youll also have to use condoms until youve been on your pill again for 8 pills.
8888,I hope this answers your question!

8907,Im about to just quit them so my skin goes back to normal because I dont want to keep waiting to see if it gets better since I feel so gross and ugly like this.

8926,"I was reading that Junel is one of the pills that have more androgenic properties, aka male hormone effects."
8927,"So that would be things like acne, oily skin, and hair loss on the head."
8928,I've been thinking about either switching or quitting completely.
8929,I'm only on it because it prevents cysts from PCOS so it's either be moody and miserable with headaches ALL the time or be moody once a week with excruciating ovary pain/extreme bloat.
8930,There's gotta be a better option out there
8931,I decided to quit last night because I hate what its doing to my skin  personality.

8942,He came in me all 4 times.
8943,Kind of a dumb question but are you still protected if you have sex multiple times in a night?
8944,I take my pills seriously at the same time everyday.
8945,Yes your pill is still over 99 effective with correct use regardless of how many times you have sex
8946,It doesnt matter how much sex you have in a day.
8947,The effectiveness isnt based on that.
8948,Its based on the course of the year.
8949,Its not based on individual time you have sex.
8950,"Someone who barely has sex and is on birth control, is just as protected as someone who has sex multiple times a day."
8951,As long as you are taking your pills religiously you are very protected.
8952,Yes.
8953,If you've taken correctly you don't ovulate.He could come in you 100 times and it wouldn't make any difference.
8954,Don't stress.
8955,The amount of sperm is irrelevant if there is no egg.

8988,honestly same Im on the withdrawal bleeding rn and the is my first time on bc so I also dont know if its normal or what.
8989,But the cramps arent bad but they are lasting longer than when I had cramps on my real period  on my real period I only had cramps on the first day.
8990,I would also like an answer.
8991,My bleeding is lighter too.
8992,Not has heavy as my real period.
8993,Is that your case too?
8994,"With my bleeding I noticed spotting I guess since  Wednesday or Thursday, but it wasnt until yesterday where I was like okay this might be my period."
8995,"But yesterday it was light brown almost, today it came full force."
8996,"I dont even know what day I would consider Im on but as of today my blood flow is mostly the same as before, quite heavy."
8997,The only changes I can say is that I usually get cramps a couple of days before my period but I didnt feel that much pain until today.
8998,Im 21F and ive always had a fear of pregnancy before being completely settled in life.
8999,I had nexplanon in the past which was extremely effective but I bled 24/7.
9000,"I switched to pills and had sex with my boyfriend but he didnt ejaculate and im obviously not pregnant, I just have a lot of fear of him doing that in me and then becoming pregnant off of it so I need advice."
9001,I take the pill regularly and mostly at the same time but I cannot have babies and have heard horror stories.
9002,Thanks.

9004,The pill is about 99.7 effective with perfect use!
9005,"Its highly effective, and millions of people rely on it without any accidental pregnancies."
9006,"Birth control failures can happen, but the vast majority of the time, its user error."
9007,"If you havent yet, make sure to read the instructions on how to take your pill (including what to do about missed/ late pills) that came with your pill pack  its very useful information and having a set of rules youre careful to follow may help with some of the anxiety!That said, theres nothing wrong with combining birth control with another nonhormonal method for peace of mind."

9019,Ive never been on bc up till now since I was never really sexually active until my first partner who would always just pull out or wear a condom.
9020,My 2nd partner was amazing at pulling out too.
9021,I never had to use any.
9022,But now Im with a new man and hes really bad at it!
9023,He always feels the condom chokes him out and is too uncomfortable to wear.
9024,Wish they made bc pills for men instead.
9025,Has anyone used the patch and felt okay or a certain bc brand pill?
9026,Its all new to me tbh
9027,Sounds like an issue with an inconsiderate partner more than an issue with birth control...
9028,He might need a bigger size condom
9029,Skyn XLs.
9030,Theyre larger and thinner.
9031,Only go on the pill/contraception if you want to.
9032,1.
9033,"Remember u both should be tested and clean before having raw sex, aids and STDs r no joke2."
9034,"If he cant wear a condom  no sex, if its uncomfortable he has to figure that out by trying different condoms."
9035,3.
9036,If u dont want BC then dont go on.
9037,"Theres also implants, IUD etc."
9038,Im on the pill and have no side effects.
9039,"Any guy who refuses to wear a piece of plastic over his penis to protect the both of you, isnt worth your time."
9040,But thats my opinion.
9041,Sounds like he isnt wearing the right size condom.
9042,22 of couples will get pregnant using the withdrawal method with typical use over a year.
9043,He need to wear one if youre not on birth control.
9044,"That being said, I was on the combo pill for 8 years and never had any terrible side effects."
9045,I just was bad at taking them.
9046,Birth control is trial and error.
9047,What works for one may not work for you.
9048,"here are your best options in no particular order1) get bigger condoms 2) if he refuses to wear a piece of plastic to prevent knocking you up, dont have sex with him3) explore the many many other birth control methods."
9049,"its trial and error, you hear horror stories because people usually focus on the bad  the good."
9050,"my pill is great for me, chances are there is one for you too"
9051,I have been on the pill and iud.
9052,I perferred the pill over hormonal iud.
9053,I had Mirena with terrible side effects.
9054,I currently have paraguard.
9055,I am liking it so far.
9056,I have had it for about 6 months now.
9057,Thank you everyone for these great answers and perspectives!
9058,"I appreciate the advice, like the helpful sisters I never had!"
9059,please don't rely on pulling out if you are avoiding pregnancy.
9060,Do you know what else is uncomfortable?
9061,Paying child support for 18 years.
9062,Or giving birth.
9063,Or hormonal birth control symptoms.Get him to try other condoms.
9064,There are countless brands.
9065,Have you been tested for STIs?
9066,"There are natural material ones that prevent pregnancy but not STIs, I believe they're called lambskin, and feel v natural."
9067,"There's also an amazing latexfree brand called Skyn, which is a bit pricier but feel much nicer than your standard rubber Durex."
9068,Shop around!
9069,"Get some samples online!There are nonhormonal methods like the copper coil, but they're not for everyone."
9070,"Don't get it unless you're 100, and don't let his selfish ass dictate what you should do with your body.If he doesn't like any of those ideas, tell him he can get a vasectomy."
9071,You shouldnt go on BC if you really dont want to.
9072,"However, I think you have some misconceptions about it."
9073,Not everyone has horrible side effects.
9074,Ive been on the implant and the pill.
9075,"I didnt do well with the implant, but the pill has been amazing."
9076,"I struggled with heavy and painful periods, and it helps me control them."
9077,I have almost no side effects.
9078,I would suggest talking to your doctor or a clinic to figure out which option is the best choice for you.
9079,Dont use the pull out as contraception its not safe or reliable you can get pregnant from precum and it dosnt protect from stis.
9080,Use condoms with new partners till ur both exclusive and have been checked them only stop using them if there is another form of contraception.
9081,This isnt a contraception issue this is a shitty partner issue.
9082,You have every right to refuse sex if you dont have the right protection.
9083,I suggest you have a long hard think about how seriously you take ur sexual health and if its a self confidence issue work on that so you feel more comfortable with ur boundaries
9084,I wouldnt do it for a partner.
9085,I did it for myself.
9086,I was on the estrogen ones like loestrin I believe was the last one I took and I felt fine with it.
9087,"However, it sounds like he needs a different size condom."
9088,"Looking back at the last 10 years of me being sexually active I wish I had someone to tell me this if he wont wear a condom hes not a good guy, theres no reason why he shouldnt respect you enough to wear one."
9089,"(Every guy complains theyre too tight) the pull out method isnt reliable, you can still get pregnant from precum, so the moment it goes in you take that risk."
9090,"Make sure you get tested and make sure the other person does too, if they wont test?"
9091,"Dont sleep with them, cause thats a massive red flag.Every form of contraception has made me feel awful, from bleeding constantly in 1 month, to weight gain, to lowering my sex drive, to horrific acne that I had for the whole of lockdown cause I couldnt get my implant removed."
9092,I just wouldnt take it given the chance again.
9093,Condoms all the way.
9094,Solution a better bf
9095,Tell him to suck it up and buy the right sized condoms.
9096,Dont feel like you have to take birth control unless you really want to.
9097,"I liked the patch the best of the hormonal methods I tried, but still didnt like the side effects so I got the copper IUD (nonhormonal) and like it so far."
9098,"I've been on the pill for almost 2 decades, my current choice is the one I've been on the longest and has been the absolute best match for me brevicon 1/35 and I take it continuously for no periods."
9099,"Going on a decade now with this one with no period and my quality of life has been just so much better than when I menstruated.There's so many options out there for the pill that if one doesn't work quite right, it might just need the hormones tweaked for you."
9100,"Like I had to go on this other one for a year and it had very similar hormones as the brevicon but it just did not suit me, one of the hormones was too high and I had repeated breakthrough bleeding and spotting with breast tenderness, then I went back on brevicon and it's golden again."
9101,"if comfort really is a concern for him, maybe explore different condom size options or even vaginal/internal condoms Ive been on nexplanon as well as pills."
9102,"for me personally, I believe hormonal birth control has a negative impact on my mental health."
9103,This is the main reason I stopped using hormonal birth control.
9104,I experienced much more depression and suicidal ideation while on hormonal birth control.
9105,"and unfortunately, after consulting w my doctor, one of the most effective nonhormonal options, the copper IUD, isnt an option for me."
9106,"and it still has some side effects, like increased crampingNexplanon made me bleed nearly every day for months."
9107,"even after my bleeding was more regular, my periods were still twice as long as before birth control."
9108,"on the pill, my periods were more manageable."
9109,"but tbh, I stayed on nexplanon for the full three years because I could tolerate w the heavy, long periods."
9110,it wasnt a big factor in why I stopped using hormonal birth controlanother issue that had an impact on my decision was my sex drive.
9111,partners influenced this to an extent.
9112,"but overall, I had way less desire for sex when I was on hormonal birth control."
9113,that sucked.
9114,sex is important to me!I wasnt on hormonal birth control for any reason other than to prevent pregnancy.
9115,so I cant speak to any other potential benefits besides not getting pregnant.
9116,"I didnt notice changes in weight, acne, etc."
9117,but everyones experience is different.
9118,"so before you get on any hormonal birth control, think about whether the possible symptoms for you outweigh the benefits for him and yalls sex life."
9119,"consider your comfort, too!"
9120,not just his
9121,Tell him to suck it up.
9122,Im on the patch and love it.
9123,But break up with your bf if he keeps acting like that.
9124,Dont go on the pill for the sake of your boyfriend.
9125,"So, I can't say for sure what your partner's issue is since a. Idk what he's got and b. I'm bias lol but it sounds like a conversation needs to happen between you two about birth control, because even with hormonal birth control, nothing is 100."
9126,"It can get you close, but it usually comes at the cost of something else."
9127,"For me, I was put on depo provera at 14 for my periods because I had extreme cramps and I never knew how it had effected me until I got off it on accident this year (weight gain, mental issues, bone density issues)."
9128,"Personally, I wouldn't risk not using a condom because I don't want children ever, so if he can't find a condom that fits/feels good, then the vag would be off limits."
9129,"If he's unwilling to even try, then he's just being inconsiderate and I wouldn't even let him in me since he's basically asking for me to put my mental and physical health at risk for his nut."
9130,Birth control isn't solely a female issue.
9131,It's up to both partners to educate and equip themselves with the tools to have sex safely
9132,"Ive tried the pill (none of the brands I tried ever agreed with me), Ive tried depo (which is alright but the heat flashes suck), and I also tried the copper IUD."
9133,I loved my copper IUD!
9134,"Non hormonal and lasts so long, I had zero side effects"
9135,Besides the options everyone is giving about him refusing to use condoms which I agree it is a big problem.
9136,"Some non hormonal options are copper iud, diaphragm, and spermicdes."
9137,The last two can be used by themselves or be combined together for extra protection.
9138,"Pill user here, the only worry i have is taking it everyday around the same time, otherwise it has work great on me."
9139,Its trial and error with birth control.
9140,I have never had any major side effects from any of them but the one Im on now drastically reduces my moodiness.
9141,But your partner should be more open to condoms.
9142,Because the pull out method is never the way to go even if they are good at it.
9143,"So many people get pregnant with the pull out method, and its just not worth risking."
9144,"Been only on the pill and idk about you, but I used to have insane cramps."
9145,"I still get cramps, but they're not that level of extreme pain, but they do happen more frequent and more often."
9146,"I also notice that my lower body feels sometimes ""bubbly"" when I'm on the pill."
9147,"I get random pains but that probably has to do with a certain condition and the pain probably gets triggered by certain hormones, because it never happens when I'm off the pill."
9148,Your partner sounds rlly inconsiderate by the way...
9149,Different condom or a different partner.
9150,"That said, everyone reacts to every kind or even brand of bc differently."
9151,I had the rod for 6 years without any side effects except it took away my period which was wonderful.
9152,"For some reason my body was done after 6yrs and I bled too much in the 7th year to keep it, otherwise I would have stuck with it."
9153,Best 6years.
9154,I got the bc implant that goes in the arm and last 3 years.
9155,I like it
9156,But also your body your choice
9157,I love the nexplanon and its never failed me well thankfully no birth control ever has Ive been on depo nexplanon and the copper iud.
9158,The one with least side effects is the nexplanon IUD sucked bleeding all the time  depo was ok.
9159,"Dont let anyone convince or force you to get on birth control, its YOUR body."
9160,Tell him you guys can try and find bigger condoms (theyre out there trust me) or he wont get to have sex with you.
9161,He sounds sort of inconsiderate and immature.
9162,"I dont think youll find birth control that doesnt cause at least SOME negative side effects, at least in my opinion."
9163,dude YOU CAN GET PREGNANT FROM PRECUM.
9164,Omg this guy is doing you a massive favour buy suggesting you go on birth control now.
9165,I've had no side effects with the mirena but the insertion is a pain.
9166,You can get low hormone pills now.
9167,I'd just experiment until you find something that works for you.
9168,"Honestly it's not that great to just rely on condoms either, it's always good to have two methods of bc."
9169,1 to all the other commenters who think it's a problem with an inconsiderate partner.
9170,"But also, I have the copper IUD and it's been great."
9171,There are lots of posts on reddit about how people have horrible experiences but I've had no problems besides a slightly heavier period.
9172,"It doesn't contain hormones so there are no hormonal side effects (for the vast majority of people), it works for 10 years, and you don't have to remember to take a pill."
9173,"Like others have said, I recommend he try different condom sizes first."
9174,And please stop using the pullout method by itself!
9175,"You can pair it with condoms or birth control if you want extra protection, but withdrawal on its own is very likely to fail."
9176,So if you don't want to get pregnant at all I would recommend using a better method.
9177,"But before you use birth control, if you are reluctant, I would definitely recommend trying Skyn condoms."
9178,They're known to be thinner and they have lots of different sizes.
9179,Idk where the person saying hormonal birth control fucks up most people got their shitty information from but that's completely false.
9180,It can have side effects but it depends on a number of things.
9181,I personally developed an allergy to synthetic estrogen so I only use progesterone IUD now and have no issues with it.
9182,I'm also a type 1 diabetic.
9183,If you have hormomal acne or issues with weight or hormones in general estrogen can cause issues.
9184,Progesterone can but not as often as estrogen does.
9185,Talk to your doctor about what is right for you because we don't know your health history.Copper IUD doesn't stop periods just fyi.
9186,Hormonal birth control can but doesn't for everyone.
9187,Okay.
9188,Hormonal BC fucks most people up.
9189,Or on some occasions it doesn't but when you swap or stop it then affects you poorly.
9190,It has side effects.
9191,But even if all BC is totally fine and dandy  IF YOU DON'T WANT IT THEN DON'T TAKE IT.
9192,"And don't have raw sex unless you're okay with accidental pregnancy and you're both absolutely on the same page with what to do when you DO get pregnant.Imo, this is how you find out if you have a considerate partner or not.Mine is particularly girthy and we've found a certain condom that works well for us both and that's our go to."
9193,"Others are awful on him and those are the ""spares"" at the bottom of the drawer that we have to reach for when we run out of our faves."
9194,It's about safety and also respect and a healthy amount of risk aversion.
9195,Also Ill add Ive always been on birth control  because Im a cum whore but nobody should pressure you into it
9196,"I get sick on the pill, but recently had to be put on the patch due to medical reasons."
9197,"I have been on it 2 months now and no side effects, so maybe the patch will do well for you too?"
9198,"On a side note, if the guy is complaining about the condom, he needs to try a different brand, different brands all are sized just a little differently and it can be that the ones he has tried are not right for him."
9199,"Obviously, it will feel better without a condom at all, but that is the price to be paid to have sex and have a lower chance of a baby."
9200,"If he refuses to keep trying different brands of condoms or to use a condom at all, tell him he is free to either not have sex or to get a vasectomy."
9201,"Birth control alone is not enough to keep you from getting pregnant, I have several friends with kids to show that."
9202,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.
9203,Questions?
9204,"First read the Mistake or Pregnancy Risk sticky( or the Consolidated Experience post( If this is an experience post please consider adding it to the listPlanned Parenthood online chat(The rules and additional resources can be found on the About / Sidepage (desktop users look to the right and Reddit app up top).I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
9205,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
9206,Junel fe 1/20 is the only bc I have not experienced horrible side effects on!
9207,"The first 2ish months were still rough and I almost gave up, but I was also going through a devastating breakup(9.5 yr relationship) and starting over in a new state when I started Junel Fe 1/20so I take those side effects with a grain of salt."
9208,But I struggle with PMDD and started it to skip periods altogether.
9209,By the 3 month mark I felt SO MUCH BETTER.
9210,"No weight gain(actually have lost weight since starting but that was intentional, not bc of birth control), skin is clearer, no period even on the placebo week(which you take once every 3 packs), even and steady mood without feeling numb(side offer of another one I tried), and no nausea."
9211,Highly recommend Junel Fe 1/20!
9212,"I tried the Nexplanon implant and it sucked, so I don't personally recommend it."
9213,I then was on Zafemy (patch) which people said was the lesser version of my current Xulane (patch) but I personally think they are both the same and work really well.
9214,I replace them every week and never worry about it otherwise.
9215,The only thing I saw people had a problem with was going from Xulane to Zafemy as the lower dosage messed with the cycle they were on.
9216,This was because whoever was producing Xulane ran out and it caused pharmacies to just give out Zafemy.
9217,But it seems to be okay now.
9218,Hope this helped!
9219,(I think you should only get BC if YOU want it )
9220,Ive been on BC for 15 years and have never had an issue.
9221,Have been on different brand and no issues with any of them.
9222,"Minimal period cramps, no acne."
9223,Etc.
9224,It has been more than beneficial.
9225,"With that being said, condoms are much less invasive and your BF should get over it."
9226,Or you should find another partner
9227,If you have any sensitivity to glue or latex be careful with the patch.
9228,It slowly ate away at my skin.
9229,Also if youre above 180200 it wont be promised to work if I remember right.
9230,Ive had side effects on all of them.
9231,On the pill I had no libido and dryness.
9232,"I had a copper IUD and I had insane cramps, but ultimately took it out because I bled for 9 months straight."
9233,I now have the Mirena iud and the cramps are still unpleasant but Ive only had it for 3 months so not sure if they will subside.
9234,BC is trial and error.
9235,Its most likely not going to be perfect on the first try.
9236,"Obviously everyones bodies react differently to different medications, but I have been on two different birth control pills."
9237,"Not only have I had 0 side effects, my periods are regular and my cramps are way more manageable!"
9238,"My bf wanted me to stop coz hes a nurse and he knows better  so I stopped after the 3months and got a big lump on my left breast and its too painful and uncomfortable.. didnt tell my bf yet and havent checked it with my doctor coz i dont wanna hear his i told u so the good things is u dont get pregnant, glowy complexion, no acnes and no painful periods."
9239,If you don't want to take the pill.
9240,Don't.
9241,"It has side effects, it will effect your body and that should be your decision you make freely and informed."
9242,Not one you make cause a guy wants you to.
9243,The mini pill has fewer side effects and risks so maybe look into that
9244,I'm on the pargard IUD.
9245,"Only issues I have with it are it makes my periods heavier,cramps more intense and makes me spot inbetween periods."
9246,Buuuut my periods have always been bad and just not regular like that so I didn't really notice that much of a difference.
9247,Ive heard that the nuva ring has more local effects as birth control so maybe youll get less side effects with that.
9248,You can try different brands.
9249,Maybe even a mini pill.
9250,"I definitely wouldnt rely on pull out method, even with men who are good at it."
9251,Condom at the least but sometimes I dont even fully trust that.
9252,Im seriously hoping for a male birth control pill in the near future!!
9253,!
9254,It really is person to person but I'm on POPS (pill) and it has had no effect on me at all.
9255,It's super effective and I'm really happy with how easy it is.
9256,Mirena implant is the only thing I can use without crazy side effects.
9257,I use the patch because I cant be bothered to take a pill on time.
9258,The only side effects I notice are acne and weird skin texture where I put the patch.
9259,I tried three different birth controls.
9260,First one was  pills and causes me massive acnes.
9261,2nd one was  also pills but different chemical and was fine but I gained so much weight from it.
9262,"3rd, is a ring."
9263,"I can forget about it for days, but it caused me unstable mood in certain days."
9264,im still recovering from going on my first bc at 17 for my partner who hated condoms.
9265,its a choice to make but dont do it if you dont 100 wanna
9266,He should not pressure you to go on birth control if you don't want to.
9267,"It sounds like he's wearing the wrong size condom, or it's just an excuse."
9268,"That said, if you want to go on birth control in the future, there isn't a brand that's objectively better or worse than others."
9269,It depends on your priorities and how your body reacts to a certain hormone formulation.
9270,"For example, methods with estrogen tend to improve acne and cause less irregular bleeding, but they can also worsen certain types of migraines and some people shouldn't use estrogen."
9271,The copper IUD is highly effective and nonhormonal.
9272,"There are also barrier methods other than condoms, like female/internal condoms or the diaphragm but they are less effective than male condoms."
9273,"First of all, dont let him pressure you into this, as others have said.That said, if you do decide youd like BC, I recommend the Kyleena IUD."
9274,"Contrary to the horror stories, not everyone has excruciating pain during insertion."
9275,"Yes, I had cramps and spotting frequently for the first couple months, but now I have 0 side effects and Ive had it 4.5 months now."
9276,Set it and forget it basically.
9277,I wish more people would give it a chance.
9278,"Just get it put in on or right around your period when your cervix is softer and more open, and go to a doc you trust and feel comfortable with."
9279,Ive been on the pill from the Brand Sprintec and Ive had almost zero side effects except for a very slightly lower sex drive.
9280,My periods got a lighter and are very regular now and before the pill they were very heavy and irregular.
9281,"Im on the patch and feel fine, no negative side effects."
9282,Im actually on it to manage my periods rather than for contraception.
9283,"try a bigger condom, if he still complains  hes being selfish."
9284,birth control is no joke and will impact your brain and body chemistry.
9285,i was on the pill for years  i wouldnt say it ruined my life but it definitely made my life way harder than necessary
9286,pulling out is not a great method.
9287,pulling out should only be used along with another method.
9288,you're lucky you haven't gotten pregnant yet.
9289,"try different condom brands with your partner, he might need a bigger size."
9290,"also please make sure you're getting screened for STIs AT LEAST once a year, even if you're in a relationship."
9291,Go low or no estrogen pill and try.
9292,I threw plates on regular birth control.
9293,Im on the mini pill from breastfeeding and I think Ill stay on it permanently.
9294,"I was on bc for over a year  It was kinda OK but I had some issues that I linked to the bc, so I wanted to stop , the thing is my partner wasn't supporting me to quit using it and he was kinda manipulative like  ""get yourself some money first because you're gonna need to save for a an abort""  so I felt very bad and anxiety with the idea I have not much support, he said I'm in your side on whatever you desire but I just know it's your sister putting you this idea to stop... stupid and bad relationship."
9295,In the end ibroke up with him and I'm off 4 months without it.
9296,I feel so relieved and I'm not sure if its cause of the bc or because I left that toxic relationship.
9297,Maybe both.
9298,I felt like a robot all the time and I almost never cried.
9299,"Now I cry but it feels good, cause I also laugh and feel more happy and I actually FEEL something."
9300,"I also have so much more Libido then before and I feel more strong and I finally have my period back and I love feeling like a woman again and I will never use bc again no matter how comfortable and convenient it is and ""no worry""."
9301,I'm happy I don't need to swallow every day a pill in 8.30 pmBut you know maybe t was the person that cause it.
9302,Maybe.the bc.
9303,Maybe both.
9304,But right now I'm just happy I'm out of it finally after 1.5 years together.
9305,Absolutely agreeing with comments saying go on the pill only if YOU want to.I went on the pill when I was 30.
9306,"Stayed 2 years on different ones  combined and progesterone only (EU brand is Slynda).Combined was too strong for me, breast pain every month as well as other PMS symptoms."
9307,"I was told it will go away but it did not for a year (I also got fibroids which I believe are from too much estrogen but no doctor wants to confirm that ofc).With progesterone only I felt great, I did not even have period at all."
9308,"But also no libido, so what's the point."
9309,Everything went back to normal after stopping.
9310,"For what it's worth, IF you WANT to go on b.c."
9311,"vs. genuinely do not want to, it's a wide world of options now, most of which have smaller doses of hormones than the options of yesteryear, with fewer/less severe side effects... for most people at least."
9312,"For me personally, the mini pill (progesterone only) has been a game changer."
9313,The estrogen in the combo pill did NOT agree with me.
9314,I almost gave up on the pill/hormonal methods completely because of what I was dealing with.
9315,"Took some trial and error to find what worked for me, which is normal, every body processes things differently."
9316,"So if you DO want to, just maybe be prepared to try a few before you find your fit, and maybe try the mini pill if you're good at taking things religiously on time (shorter forgiveness window).As for the condoms, my partner learned the hard way with me he was using the wrong size his whole life."
9317,"Always having issues with them unrolling, slipping, sliding off... we tried large/XL after I reassured him a bunch that he's... uh ""blessed"" in that department... suddenly zero issues haha."
9318,"More sensation, nearly zero issues with it staying put, etc."
9319,"Basically, it's all about working together as a team to find the right options one size simply doesn't fit all (for any gender)."
9320,For sure.
9321,Communication is key here for both of you
9322,Or the snug size.
9323,Worked out with a regular hook up I had a few years back.
9324,He said he could actually feel me.
9325,(Reminder that he's probably lying ab it being tight.
9326,Have him try them all.
9327,)Final addonPut a drop or 2 of lube inside the tip of the condom and make sure there's no air when you roll it on.
9328,"The condom part is just an excuse for him because he doesn't want to wear one, OP I know until now it worked but you CAN get pregnant from pulling out, it is not a good method!"
9329,The copper IUD is non hormonal but gives you a heavier flow.
9330,"If you don't want to use birth control, then don't, please don't put ur body through it."
9331,If he doesn't want to wear condoms because it makes him 'uncomfortable' why would you have to take birth control that makes you (way more) uncomfortable??
9332,He doesn't sound like a good bf.
9333,Or a wide condom.
9334,Ive noticed that condoms not fitting seems to more of an issue with partners who are wider than partners who are longer.
9335,You can purchase them on Amazon( or even at your local store.
9336,I would highly recommend looking into this!
9337,Period
9338,"Also love Paraguard, but I agree with everyone that is saying she should only get on bc if she wants to."
9339,This answer right here.
9340,"This is something you should decide to do on your own because you want to do it, not some lame ass bf."
9341,"If its uncomfortable, he should look at other condoms and other ways to fix that instead of immediately suggesting you get on medication that greatly affects your body."
9342,I was just thinking this.Like yes of course you shouldn't do something like starting birth control if you don't want to.
9343,"But sounds like they've never tried it and just heard all about bad experiences when, similar to you, I had no problems with the birth control pill I tried (Loryna)."
9344,I had the same problems with Nexplanon.
9345,I couldn't take it any more after nine months of spotting every day and had it removed.
9346,I had the exact same experience with nexplanon
9347,"I have had Mirena for a little over a month now too, I have had no side effects"
9348,Birth control alone IS meant to be relied on and is suffient as the sole form of contraception.
9349,"No form of contraception is 100, but the vast majority of people rely on their bc and are protected."
9350,"While it's unfortunate it didn't work for your friends, sewing distrust in bc is not helpful and it's also why a lot of people get anxious and think they need plan B on top of their regular bc."
9351,I cant tell what issues are coming from my Nexplanon and what issues are coming from other things.
9352,It sucks not knowing!
9353,But I trust this BC more than anything elze
9354,Please get checked and if he says I told you so for getting checked for possible cancer then hes not a good boyfriend
9355,this keeps making me laugh..
9356,I assume yall are talking about paraGARD the copper iud and not paraGUARD the parasite cleanse
9357,The birth control pill is 93 effective and that is for perfect conditions.
9358,Every gyno I have been to has told me to either use a condom with the bc pill or to not have sex if I don't want a child.
9359,This is even more important to think about in a world where it is harder and harder to get an abortion if something fails.
9360,"I bled for 9 months straight, then was on the pill (prescribed for 3 months) with my Nexplanon as my OBGYN thought it would cause the bleeding to stop."
9361,"It did while I was in the pill, but once I stopped, the bleeding came back."
9362,I had it removed and patches are much better in my opinion.
9363,Or the PARAGard that's a paraffin wax repellent
9364,"That's not true, the birth control pill is 99 effective with perfect use, it's 93 effective with typical (error) use."
9365,Things like the arm implant are more effective than sterilization.
9366,"IUDs are over 99, since there is no human error like taking a pill."
9367,"Most doctors will recommend condoms for std protection, especially if you're young."
9368,"It's your choice if you want partners to use condoms but fostering mistrust in bc, especially if you don't know the efficacy, is no bueno"
9369,The IUD is 99.9 percent affective and so is the implant..
9370,My gyno told me the 93 thing.
9371,"Also, my most recent gyno knows I have been married for over a decade and I'm 34, yet still told me to also use condoms."
9372,"Obviously panned parenthood is correct, as they do studies, I'm just literally repeating what my gyno told me."
9373,"You also completely ignored why I am saying to use a condom with the bc pill, it is due to the fact that it is so hard to get an abortion if something were to fail."
9374,"Where I live, I would have to drive hours to get to a place and then hope I noticed my pregnancy in time to get an abortion."
9375,"I'm not trying to foster mistrust in the bc pill, I'm trying to warn people that it is able to fail and it is better to have a second form of birth control to try to cover that failing since abortions are so hard to get now."
9376,I don't want someone to end up with a child they don't want just because they were told the birth control pill alone was enough.
9377,I never talked about the IUD or the implant so I'm confused by this reply.
9378,"People are welcome to err on the side of whatever caution they want but your original point was ""birth control is not enough to rely on to not get pregnant"" which is completely untrue and does encourage mistrust in bc methods as a whole (pill, shot, IUDs, etc)."
9379,"Not everyone lives in the States either, which is why personal risk aversion levels differ."
9380,"But a lot of people are already on this sub doubling up and panicking about taking plan B when they're already on the pill, shot, patch etc and their condom breaks."
9381,The majority of the protection is supposed to come from the hormonal method.
9382,Did you not say birth control in general is not enough?
9383,Those are forms of birth control that are basically 100 percent effective.
9384,"And the other user proved you wrong about the pill, so just trying to combat this misinformation."
9385, Every gyno I have been to has told me to either use a condom with the bc pill or to not have sex if I don't want a child.My exact words here.
9386,I said nothing about IUD or the implant.
9387,"And then you said Birth control alone is not enough to keep you from getting pregnant, I have several friends with kids to show that.An IUD and implant is under that category of birth control and is basically all the way effective."
9388,My OB told me the IUD is perfectly fine to use alone to not get pregnant.
9389,Your anecdotes dont disprove the effectiveness of these methods.
9390,I'm on the combined contraceptive pill (Rigevedon) and have been for a month.
9391,I take no other medications.
9392,I've been taking it every day and have started spotting today.
9393,I'm due my period according to my period tracker.
9394,Could this bleeding mean it's not working?
9395,My mood is also all over the place as I usually am before and when I get my period.
9396,Possibly worse.
9397,"Any insight would be so appreciated, I don't have anyone to ask."
9398,Irregular bleeding is a very common side effect during the first 3 months.
9399,"Its stressful that it happened to coincide with when your period wouldve been, but its likely just a coincidence!"

9404,Hello all!
9405,Im a 26 yo female and have never used any kind of hormonal birth control before (only condoms and pull out).
9406,Now Im in a long term relationship and wanted to give bc a try cause waiting for my period every month has been a little stressful so my doctor prescribed me with minipills (Desogestrel) and Im supposed to start it on the first day of my period which is today.
9407,"There are some questions Id like to get answers to, but I completely forgot about asking these to my doctor, so here I am hahaI know for some people the minipill stops the period completely, some people just get an occasional bleeding and some unlucky ones (I hope Im not gonna be one of those) just get constant bleeding/spotting."
9408,"And as youre supposed to take it continuously without a break, youre not getting actual periods."
9409,"(correct me if Im wrong please, these are just based on my research and what my doctor has told me) My question here would be how would I know that Im not pregnant, if the bleedings (if Ill get any) are not actual periods?"
9410,Is there a way to know for sure that Im not pregnant without taking a test?
9411,"And if I should take occasional pregnancy tests, when is the best time to take these and in what frequency?Another point that Id like to figure out how long after starting the pill will I be protected?"
9412,And lastly for most of the minipills the window is pretty narrow and you have to take it at the exact same time every day and thats what my doctor told me too when he prescribed me.
9413,"But I read that Desogestrel has a 12h window, like the combo pills."
9414,"And on another entry here someone asked a very good question about minipills that was unanswered if the window is that narrow and you have to take it at same time every day, does that mean that the pill is no longer as affective on the few hours before youre supposed take the next pill?"
9415,"And if yes, does this apply to Desogestrel too?"
9416,Id appreciate any kind of help!
9417,!
9418,Hi!
9419,Ive been on Desogestrel for 2 years and to be honest I just take pregnancy tests every couple of months when I know Ive been active.
9420,"I just buy the cheap multipacks and do one when I remember because youre right, its pretty hard to tell when you dont have a period at all!!"
9421,I think when it is effective depends when you start taking it I think if you take it within your period then youre protected right away but otherwise it might take a few days to work according to the NHS website.
9422,"As for the window, I usually take mine roughly at the same time every day, but I have never once been very strict or set alarms."
9423,"As you say, the window for missed pills is 12 hours so I just try to take mine around 910am everyday but I dont stress too much, and I have never even had a pregnancy scare doing that."
9424,I think on the website I linked it says as long as you take it within 12 hours of the same time each day youre protected  but someone please correct me if thats wrong!
9425,!

9430,Thank you so much for all your answers!!
9431,Taking a pregnancy test every now and then feels like the safest way.
9432,Lets see if Ill get any period at all.
9433,"But do you know by any chance that if you do get a period, is it a normal period that confirms that youre not pregnant or is it just a bleeding that occurs as a side effect of the pill?"
9434,"I was thinking about asking to do a mini pill, I've never taken bc before.. only condoms."
9435,How are your symptoms on this one?
9436,Any side effects?
9437,"Id still use condoms if I took bc though, pregnancy is an absolute no for me lol"
9438,I think if you get bleeds while taking them they are actual periods rather than withdrawal bleeds but I could be wrong about that so I would do some research..
9439,"I think its because mini pills dont aaaalways prevent ovulation, but desogestrel in particular is really effective at stopping ovulation and periods compared to other mini pills from what I have read !"
9440,I know I have not had a period at all from the day I started taking it haha.
9441,hope this helps you! )
9442,I have to take it because I get migraines to be honest its not been great for me!
9443,"before my migraine episodes I was on a low dose combined pill which worked really well for me, and switching to mini pill basically brought back a lot of side effects that originally switching to a low dose pill had solved  I am looking to try some different types of mini pill to see if it helps me but after 2 years on desogestrel Ive had just awful mood swings, non stop acne and a little bit weight gain."
9444,The only bonus is I havent had a period or any bleeding at all for 2 years and I used to have debilitating periods before.
9445,I have anxiety usually and I think that for me the pill I take makes it much worse because of the mood swings.
9446,I wouldnt let this deter you from trying it though!
9447,I know loads of people who get on really well with it ) I think its probably just not for me personally and hopefully the others I will try might have better results lol
9448,"Will look more into it then, thank you!!"
9449,xx
9450,I too have debilitating periods and every month I'm angry at myself for not trying bc.
9451,"Thats a big reason I thought about the mini pill, but I already have anxiety issues so I don't want them to make it worse."
9452,At this point I'm ready to just get my uterus cut out but that'll never happen
9453,hi guys!
9454,"Ive been on slynd for about 6 months, sometimes skip my placebos, sometimes take them to have a period."
9455,"slynd is my only method of contraception.I usually take my pill between 10pm2am, mainly between 1012 but some variations with my work schedule have made it a little later a few days this month."
9456,"Im in the last week of my pack, fell asleep way early, and took my 2nd to last active white pill a little late, at 6am the morning after I should have taken it."
9457,Im now at the point where I should be starting my placebo pills.
9458,"I know slynd has a different window (one that can be confusing to research when every website lists progestin pills as having a 3hr window), would i still be protected if i decided to go ahead and finish my pack as normal this month, including my placebos?"
9459,i have regular unprotected sex and want to make sure Im not putting myself in a bad position.
9460,would starting my new pack a day early help at all?
9461,should i skip the placebos entirely?
9462,or am I still fully protected and being slightly paranoid?thanks in advance!

9469,Hi please help!Took plan b 15 hours after intercourse.
9470,"Used condom but we used it for about an hour and when he went to tie a knot in it, it broke so just to be sure cause i didn't fully trust it, i wanted to take plan b. Ive taken a different brand a month ago, had lots of pain so i tried a new brand."
9471,"I was on my last period day when we had intercourse, in the evening bleeding had stopped, but it suddenly started bleeding again after taking the pill."
9472,I have been bleeding for 5 days since thenI thought it might be a vaginal tear but then again i had some bloodclots today so i dont think thats it and it does not hurt too.
9473,What could it be and when will it end?Could it be implantation spotting ?
9474,(Sorry for my broke english)Im just scared really

9481,"Thank you, Reason why i was mostly worried is bc i took it on my last period day, i did not experience this last time i took it."
9482,and i have been lightly bleeding for long now but i guess it's a side effect.
9483,How long does this typically last?

9485,and i have been lightly bleeding for long now.
9486,"But thank you, good to know!"
9487,Theres no way to predict how long itll last.
9488,Some side effects last for a couple months r/planbs
9489,does anyone have experience switching from the pill to an arm implant?
9490,"ive been on lo loestrin fe for nearly 9 years (1625) and ive had a great experience with it, but i live in florida and im super concerned about the possibility of losing access to the pill."
9491,"i dont plan to try to conceive for the next 35 years, so the timing would work great for me."
9492,"im just concerned about experiencing side effects from nexplanon, since i had such a good experience on the pill, im scared to try something new and mess up a good thing."
9493,would love to hear from people who have made a similar switch!
9494,!
9495,I was on the pill for 8 years and became so bad about taking my pill so I made the switch to Nexplanon in February.
9496,I had some side effects on the pill like weight gain and low libido but nothing that were terrible.
9497,"After switching to Nexplanon I had some acne for the first couple months, no bleeding for a couple months and Ive recently had some spotting for a few weeks."
9498,Its annoying but not too bad.
9499,My libido immediately returned though which I very much appreciate.
9500,Of course everyone will experience different side effects so nothing can unfortunately predict what side effects youll have.
9501,For me personally the minimal side effects are worth it considering how effective Nexplanon is.

9509,I havent but I honestly havent been trying lol
9510,"real LMAO, ty!"
9511,!
9512,"Hello, as the title states, Im scared I may be pregnant."
9513,"I have had my nexplanon in since October of 2019, but my OB stated that the effectiveness had gone up to five years."
9514,"I found another OB to give me a second opinion, and they told me the same."
9515,My partner and I very foolishly sometimes dont even use the pullout method.
9516,"I know looking back I probably shouldve doubled up, but my OB told me that having a nexplanon was more effective than sterilization."
9517,"I few weeks ago.. not that long ago, I noticed a light brown spotting in my underwear maybe 5 ish days after I had sex."
9518,"Looking back at the flow app, it seems I had sex during my fertile window as well."
9519,"I am now several days late on my period, and Im worried I may be pregnant."
9520,Has anyone ever had this happen?
9521,"Nexplanon stops ovulation, so its unlikely you have a fertile window at all."
9522,"With long term hormonal birth control, its pretty common to have weird (or no) periods and whacky spotting."
9523,Its very unlikely youre pregnant.
9524,Theres no need to double up on protection unless you want to.
9525,Nexplanon is as effective as birth control gets without removing organs.
9526,You dont have a fertile window on Nexplanon as it stops ovulation.
9527,Irregular bleeding is common.
9528,You can always test to ease your mind but theres no real need to be concerned about pregnancy.
9529,Spotting or irregular bleeding with Nexplanon is not indicative of pregnancy.
9530,If youre worried take a test.
9531,"None of your providers have lied to you, all information you reported is true and accurate."
9532,Nexplanon is effective for 5 years and it is a little more effective than a vasectomy.

9537,Im a 20 year old female and Im on the depo shot.
9538,"Ive been on the shot consistently for over a year and since Ive been consistent, Ive put on 20 pounds."
9539,"Before being on it consistently, I would stay around the 155160 area but now I cant get below 175."
9540,Its driving me insane.
9541,Im on it due my PCOS and horrible cramps.
9542,I like the shot because it stops my periods and has been very effective as far as pregnancies go.
9543,I dont really want to switch.
9544,What has helped you with this weight gain?
9545,The weight gain wasnt drastic until after I graduated high school and got into college.
9546,Ive also been in a year long healthy relationship.
9547,I just want realistic advice for a broke college student who barely has time for dieting or meal prepping.
9548,"I'm also on depo, and normally, I would put more weight on my thighs."
9549,"But now its on my stomach, I think its because of low estrogen."
9550,"What helps me, is jogging and weight lifting."
9551,"And my mindset is ""the weight wont change after 1 workout."
9552,"Be consistent and you will see change""."
9553,It does make me gain weight faster.
9554,In the past i didnt need to workout to lose weight.
9555,Now I need to.
9556,But the pro's outweight the cons for me.
9557,"I like no periods, and no pregnancies."
9558,And I cannot use estrogen so pills is not for me.

9568,"During orgasm I feel a fleeting pain, kind of pinchy?"
9569,It lasts a few seconds and then is gone.
9570,"(Even nonpenetrative orgasm) I have really small fingers, but I can feel the strings so I haven't been worried."
9571,Today I felt as far as I could and there are two textures.
9572,It's hard to tell if it's the plastic.
9573,"It isn't super firm but it's more firm than the string, though the same size."
9574,And it's much shorter (I assume the plastic of the IUD.)
9575,I don't hurt or bleed much at all outside of this.

9585,"Bleeding would come and go, but got less frequent."
9586,I sometimes had horrible cramps and no bleeding.
9587,My period started coming less and less frequently.
9588,Now I dont really have a formal period.
9589,Every so often I get the bleeding for a week straight or life 4 days straight like a typical period.
9590,But more and more often I will have like heavy bleeding and cramping like Im on my period and then it stops.
9591,Like 1 to 2 days.
9592,And more than once a month.
9593,Like 3 or 4 times a month.
9594,Ive also noticed these mini periods happen after sex a lot.
9595,Any ideas?

9602,I hate it and I hate myself but I am afraid to go off the pill in case it's just how I am now.What are your experiences?
9603,I really need help.
9604,Im sorry that youre feeling this way.
9605,"I dont think your doctor lied, but everyone reacts differently to hormones and they cant guarantee that you wont have side effects."
9606,Sometimes it takes trying a few types before you find what works best for you.
9607,"Certainly, you have the option to stop taking this pill and see if you feel better  but should consider another form of contraception if you go off and do not want to become pregnant."
9608,You can always go back on the pill if you want.
9609,"That said, you are about 6 months postpartum and the symptoms you are describing could also be postpartum depression or postpartum anxiety."
9610,So it may be worth it to get evaluated by a mental health provider (especially one who specializes in pregnancy/postpartum).
9611,Your doctor semi lied.
9612,"Some people dont experience that, but birth control absolutely does that in others."
9613,I had the same experience!!!
9614,"I had been on the birth control pill for 11 years with no issues and this year they stopped making my pill and my doctor switched me to ""essentially the same thing"" with ethinyl estradiol."
9615,When I tell you that I thought I was losing my God damn mind.
9616,I was having extreme bouts of anger and irritability when I previously was a super chill person and all of a sudden I was crying almost constantly out of absolutely nowhere.
9617,I even cried while speaking with my doctor about these side effects and how I need to get off this pill.
9618,I almost lost my job in those 3 months cause my emotions were crippling me.
9619,"Needless to say, I stopped taking it, got an IUD and have never looked back."
9620,It sounds like it could be related.
9621,I did that combo for 1213 yrs and I was just...meaner.
9622,i did the ethinyl estradiol and cried so much

9629,I dont think your doctor lied.

9631,"For example, Ive had basically no side effects with mine but my friend takes the same one and gets two week long periods so shes going to switch brands soon."
9632,It could be a side effect of this specific pill.
9633,"Other pills might give you other effects, ok?"
9634,"That said, what you are reporting is not unexpected for postpartum/infant phase as well."
9635,thats exactly what i took and it made me CRAZY  i switched to the copper IUD and its so much better
9636,"Wow, I'm glad to hear someone who can relate!"
9637,This sounds just like me.
9638,Do you have any side effects with the iud?
9639,And do you mind me asking if you got the copper iud?
9640,"The copper iud is what I wanted when I went into my appointment, but the dr strongly urged me not to unless it was necessary."
9641,"My dr is a woman and very nice, so I just went with her recommendation"
9642,I got the liletta hormone IUD because I have PCOS so I needed to keep a level of hormones.
9643,I really like it!!
9644,It's small and good for 8 years.
9645,"It was a little tough to adjust to physically, but emotionally I felt better almost immediately."
9646,I also realized that a lot of anxiety/depression stuff was exacerbated by my pill.
9647,I feel soooo much more consistent and mentally well on the IUD.
9648,"The negative side effects are that my periods have been a little unpredictable while I adjust, though 3 months in, they are getting more regular."
9649,I usually have one day of pretty notable cramps/back pain.
9650,And I can definitely tell my energy levels are affected by where I am in my cycles.
9651,But that also might be because this is the first time that I'm actually having a cycle in the last 11 years.
9652,im mad too bc they said the same thing to me

9659,So I'm a little over 9 weeks postpartum and I kinda jumped the gun on getting back on the pill since it was what I always used before.
9660,I ended starting them on what I thought was the last day of my period because that was just when I picked them up and only ended up taking the 2 because I just decided they're not for me anymore.
9661,Now it's 3 days later and I'm starting to spot again is this normal?

9666,"Hi, I'm just trying to get some reassurance."
9667,My fiance is on BC because of hormonal reasons.
9668,We were under the impression that hormonal birth control completely stops ovulation and I understand that this is the case for 99 of women.
9669,But I recently read that there is a chance of ovulation for some women on Nexplanon.
9670,"Now I know that the mucus is also thickened, so that it would be really difficult for sperm to go into an egg."
9671,But we are not really concerned about pregnancy and more worried about what might happen to that fertilized egg if the 0.01 percent chance happens and the egg fails to implant due to a thinner uterine wall.
9672,"My fiance needs BC because of her medical condition, but we would feel guilty if a fertilized egg failed to implant because of our actions."
9673,We are just wondering if anyone knows of an option where ovulation is impossible and if there is a way to tell if ovulation has occurred?
9674,"For our own peace of mind.Edit I suppose a hormonal birth control that doesn't thin the uterine lining would also work, but neither of us could find one that didn't do that?"
9675,"Fertilized eggs dont implant all the time for lots of reasons, birth control or not."
9676,"The odds of this happening are very low, and it seems like an oddly specific thing to feel guilty about if it were to somehow happen."
9677,If you really cant get past it then perhaps use condoms as well?
9678,just to really make sure it doesnt occur
9679,"People who use hormonal birth control are less likely to have a fertilized egg that fails to implant compared to people who use less effective methods.That's because failed implantation is naturally very common, and people on BC almost never release an egg that can be fertilized to begin with."
9680,Nexplanon reliably stops ovulation for the first 3 years of use.
9681,"It has been proven to be effective for 5 years, but some women start to ovulate in the 4th and 5th year."
9682,"So if your fiance doesn't want to ovulate on birth control ever, she will probably want to avoid extended use of the same implant and get it replaced at 3 years."
9683,Most people who have hormonal IUDs or take norethindrone/levonorgestrel minipills ovulate regularly.
9684,But all other hormonal methods stop ovulation in 9799 of cycles.
9685,It's not 100 because it's pretty much impossible to make a medication that never failsFertility awareness methods (that let you track ovulation) are not really compatible with hormonal birth control.
9686,I'd recommend using a barrier method like condoms if you want to lower the chance of fertilization happening although it is very low to begin with
9687,Different birth controls work differently.
9688,I don't know where you are based but in the UK we haveProgesterone Only Pill  the completely stops ovulation so you end up not having a period etc.the implant and hormonal IUD are similar.Combined Pill which you take for 3 weeks then have a week break.
9689,Sometimes stops ovulation but generally works by stopping implantation.
9690,Why would you feel guilty if a fertilised egg doesn't implant?
9691,"Even if you aren't on birth control, the uterus wall is a really hostile place and the likelihood of implanting is really low (that's why men produce millions and millions of sperm to increase the very very small chance of implantation)."
9692,"This is if the egg even gets fertilised at all, the chance of ovulation and then the chance of fertilisation is so so small on birth control."
9693,"I would recommend you use condoms if you're so worried.The key give away to ovulation is it hurts, usually a sharp pain on one side."
9694,Smart watches also tell you when you ovulate based on skin temperature and there are also apps that can help with cycle tracking  however this will be wildly inaccurate if on birth control.

9715,"I wont lie I enjoyed it when I was younger because I didnt have to worry about my period, my period was a bit unpredictable so I had a few shares of bleeding in class, but once I started depo it completely stopped my period  it also helped get my acne under control but now Im a bit of regret that Ive been on it too long."
9716,Ive been really oblivious to the side effects now Im a bit worried I might have damaged my body a bit.
9717,For example the bone loss density.
9718,I have also steadily gained weight each year but the last couple years Ive been on it I have gained a lot of weight.
9719,I tried dieting and exercise but the weight wont budge and I have tried everything!!!!
9720,"Its like once you gain it, its literally impossible to get rid of."
9721,"Ive also noticed my hair is shedding way more than usual, my hair is thinning out right on my bangs so its pretty noticeable for me at least and this is causing another confidence issue as Im already overweight."
9722,Im also on blood pressure control medication.
9723,I feel so dumb for letting myself be on this birth control so long honestly not having a period and barely any cramp was so luxurious I forgot of all the other side effects.
9724,Im getting off depo as I took my last shot a few weeks earlier and cancelled my upcoming appointment.

9730,A hormonal shift like this might really mess you up.
9731,TW Small reference to feeling violated in a medical setting below.
9732,"Not descriptive.So, today I got Kyleena IUD and I am SO proud of myself for getting through the procedure."
9733,I was actually prescribed Valium by my PCD but forgot to get the prescription (thanks ADHD) and my anxiety was horrible when I realized I wouldnt be able to be under today because I was so scared of the pain.
9734,But I had a very sweet female doctor who didnt even flinch when I felt myself about to cry with anxiety.
9735,She told me we could do it today without Valium or schedule another day.
9736,"Well, Id been waiting and rescheduling for several weeks, so I thought I would just lay back and give it up for the poor souls in purgatory."
9737,"I told her I wanted to just get it over with and while she was handing me a tissue box and comforting me I started calming down and explained my situation.For reference, I had a super painful (DRY) pap smear with an older female doctor about 2 years ago and havent had one since because I felt somewhat violated when she didnt stop immediately when I told her to stop."
9738,It was also totally unexpected and she pushed it on me to get it during that physical.
9739,"In between that time and today, Id lost my virginity, but I think because I was never very sporty as a child and always used pads that I never popped my hymen (95 sure I ended up doing it on my own when using a sex toy at 22)."
9740,"The pap smear ended up feeling fine, just tickly."
9741,The procedure was alright as they measured my uterus but wasnt the greatest.
9742,I am heavily on my period so I might have to do the smear again next time but I would totally recommend getting the IUD while you are on your period if you can  just due to the lubrication.
9743,"When she inserted it, its not to be sugar coatedit hurt like a son of a bitch in my uterus."
9744,My vagina itself was fine the entire time.
9745,"As she moved it around, I started crying out like a wuss, because Jesus Christ, if thats what a contraction feels like, I will never be having kids!"
9746,!The pain lasted a little over a minute and she warned me every time when it would spike.
9747,The nursing students in the room were so nice and instructed me to breathe deeply.
9748,"I was so embarrassed because there were 5 people in there, and I was shouting in pain involuntarily, but once she was finished and took out the dilator, the pain slowly subsided into cramps instead of shooting pain."
9749,"The nurse and doctor in charge told me I should be proud of myself for getting through it and honestly, yeah, I am!"
9750,Im so glad I had such supportive medical staff.
9751,Within an hour I felt pretty much back to normal.
9752,"But after its all said and done, Im happy I was honest with my doctor about the incident 2 years ago and my anxiety disorder."

9774,Thanks!
9775,So I have been tracking for awhile now.
9776,And recently had unprotected sex with my boyfriend 23 days before my predicted ovulation.
9777,He did not finish inside me and I took a plan b 10 hours later.
9778,I felt nauseous and exhausted for a day.
9779,Then on my predicted day of ovulation I took a clear blue ovulation test.
9780,It showed peak fertility!
9781,"However, I know that an LH surge can still happen without ovulation, especially after taking plan b.  I have also been having mild cramps and fatigue the past days."
9782,"Then 4 days after the last test, today, I took another ovulation test and it was negative."
9783,Does this indicate that I did still ovulate on my predicted day?
9784,Is it likely that my plan b failed?
9785,And how concerned should I be rn?
9786,Obviously have no other choice than to be more careful and wait to take a test.
9787,Just looking for some insight/peace of mind.Edit I retook an ovulation test today when I actually had to pee and it came back as peak fertility??
9788,So could that mean I AM ovulating rn and my plan b worked?
9789,TMI but I have been very horny and cramps the last couple days.
9790,Yes it is possible the Plan B failed.
9791,Pullout is 96 effective with perfect use and 78 effective with typical use over a year.
9792,Take a test 1421 days after sex and use condoms if you dont want to get pregnant.
9793,It doesnt really help to track ovulation if youre going to have sex right before it.
9794,Sperm can survive for up to 5 days and ovulation can always shift around.
9795,Check out r/FAMnNFP if you really want to keep cycle tracking but it might not be a good fit for you.
9796,You also cannot rely on any form of cycle tracking for 3 months after taking Plan B.
9797,You will need to use condoms for a minimum of 3 months.
9798,"Unfortunately, Plan B isnt 100 effective."
9799,The odds are low just because you did take it and you did use withdrawal which adds a small amount of protection.
9800,Take a test in 21 days and reevaluate your plan going forward.

9805,I took plan b when I was ovulating and I didnt get pregnant
9806,Its possible it failed.
9807,Its also possible the hormones are making you feel ill. Take a pregnancy test in a few weeks.
9808,Okay very good point.
9809,quit edit hahaEdit I retook an ovulation test today when I actually had to pee and it came back as peak fertility??
9810,So could that mean I AM ovulating rn and my plan b worked?
9811,TMI but I have been very horny and cramps the last couple days.
9812,Ovulation tests can be pretty hard to read especially if you dont take them daily.
9813,Considering you took Plan B I wouldnt put too much stock in any test other than the pregnancy test in 21 days.
9814,Okay thats fair haha.
9815,Just trying to read into everything I can lol
9816,I'm on sprintec but want something that will for sure make my periods stop.
9817,I've tried skipping the off week and just going right into the next pack and it just makes me have constant spotting.
9818,"I (F28) decided to give DepoProvera a shot, you know, that 3month birth control injection thing.When I went to see my OBGYN, she was like, ""Hey, do you know about the possible side effects?"""
9819,"It was kinda important because where I'm from, talking about stuff like sex and birth control isn't really a thing, and people aren't too clued in."
9820,But you know what?
9821,I really appreciated her bringing it up.
9822,It felt like she had my back.
9823,"So, I told her I'd done my homework and felt like Depo was a good fit for me.Just FYI, the side effects I mentioned to my doc included mood swings, weight gain, delayed periods, and a bit of a libido dip  I got hit with all of those."
9824,"Plus, I had some spotting now and then, to the point where I had to wear pantyliners every day."
9825,"Weirdly enough, I didn't have this spotting when I tried that onemonth injection a few years back.My period made a comeback like 2 to 3 months after I ditched Depo, but during that time, I turned into a food monster, and my partner and I had to deal with my rollercoaster moods."
9826,"The one thing that still bugs me is the weight gain I can't seem to shake those extra pounds.Oh, and by the way, despite what some folks might think (although I might be wrong), Depo didn't magically clear up my acne."
9827,"Nope, I actually got breakouts in new places, like my neck."
9828,Ugh.But you know what?
9829,It did its main job  no pregnancy scares.
9830,"Although I did take pregnancy tests now and then, just to be super careful.My doc hammered home the whole ""keep a healthy lifestyle"" thing if I stuck with Depo, especially to tackle the weight gain."
9831,I used to be on sprintec and had bad spotting if I skipped periods.
9832,I then went to the nuvaring and used it to only have a period every few months.
9833,Now I have the Mirena IUD and after a few months have completely lost my period.
9834,"I was on the extended birth control pill called Indayo for years, was able to take it for 46 months continuously (marketed for 90 days, then 7 days placebo) without withdrawal bleed."
9835,I was on depo provera for a year and bled the entire time (not just spotting).
9836,"I have had the mirena IUD for a year and a half, and havent had a withdrawal bleed since the last one before I got it."
9837,Every body is different though!
9838,"My doctor was sure that the depo shot would stop withdrawal bleeding, and the exact opposite happened."

9844,Yeah I already tend to gain weight easily so I think I'm gonna say no if Depo gets suggested by my doctor.
9845,I don't like getting shots anyways lol
9846,Did the bleeding get heavier or more irregular at the start when you got the Mirena IUD?
9847,"Definitely not heavier, Ive always had very heavy periods."
9848,I just had spotting every couple weeks for a few months that steadily got longer and longer between times before it stopped completely
9849,This summer has been absolute hell trying to find the right birth control for me.
9850,I was on the pill and the nuvaring.
9851,Both made my anxiety and depression so much worse that I just couldnt do it anymore.
9852,Do any anxiety/depression sufferers have a good birth control option that works for them?
9853,"Im thinking about a cervical cap, copper iud, or tracking with natural cycles."
9854,my POP improved my mental health and made me feel a lot more stable.
9855,but it is different for everyone.
9856,it takes a huge amount of trial and error before you find the right method for you
9857,Paragard has been it for me so far.
9858,"Long term Lilletta, Lo Loestrin, 2 skylas (some pre and post baby), nuvaring, yaz, etc."
9859,Im finally living my best life on the Paragard.
9860,"When we realized it was my birth control causing my crazy wild anxiety issues, I sore off birth control but I also dont want another baby."

9866,Following to see responses as I'm still trying to find this white whale myself.
9867,5 different combo pills have been bad for me.
9868,I thought I had it with norethindrone but then the anxiety ramped way up after a few weeks on it.
9869,"About to try Slynd.Mentally I feel great when I'm off hormonal birth control, other than in my luteal."
9870,"Unfortunately I'm using HBC to manage 'period flu' in my luteal  heavy/painful bleeding, so nonhormonal isn't a helpful option for me."
9871,However in your case I would agree something like the copper IUD would be very worth looking into!
9872,"I have yet to find any hormones or doses that don't increase my anxiety, personally.ETA if you try Natural Cycles, pair it with a secondary method."
9873,"I do think it can be helpful to closely tune into your cycle like that, if you're regular."
9874,I just wouldn't rely on it alone for contraception.
9875,Severe anxiety  periods of severe depression basically my whole life and Annovera has been fantastic.
9876,PMDD was actually making things much worse and it has fixed it.
9877,Having depression and/or anxiety doesn't guarantee a bad time on the pill.There are multiple forms of the pill.
9878,It's not just one thing.
9879,Did you try a progestinonly pill?
9880,I've heard ppl have good experiences with Slynd.
9881,"Marvelon helped with my anxiety, but YMMV."
9882,What was your experience like on Skyla?
9883,!
9884,"Same as Lilletta, 12 day periods but I never got pregnant and they were light days."
9885,"I got my nexplanon on September 7th, would i be safe to have unprotected sex today September 15th ?"
9886,It takes 7 days for the implant to kick in if it was not put in on the first 5 days of your period.

9895,Hi!
9896,I was on the pill most my life and now have an IUD compared the the pill I enjoy it because the extra estrogen wasnt great for my migraines.
9897,And is an increase risk for blood clotting for people like me who get migraines with aura I no longer need a constant reminder to take my pills at night and my heavy periods are for the first time in my entire life light.

9911,"Its a combo pill so you have a 12 hour window to take it so youre taking it around at a consistent time, and if escitalopram effected birth control then I would have been fucked years ago lol."
9912,That medication does not affect it.
9913,"As long as you are taking your birth control consistently you are protected from pregnancy, it prevents ovulation, thickens cervical mucus and thins the uterine lining to protect you."
9914,"You will be having protected sex, not unprotected sex."
9915,As long as you two are strictly monogamous then things are fine.
9916,Meaning as long as there is no risk of any STDs or anything of that matter.

9922,I really appreciate your input.
9923,I get so much anxiety about things that could go wrong so its comforting to know Im doing the right thing
9924,"I (15 ftm) started birth control sept 14th 2023, I started my period on that date as well, usually Im a medium bleeder but for some reason ever since I started it my period has been lighter than usual for the first two days."
9925,The nurse (school sexual health nurse) who I got it from said that if I take it continuously without the sugar pills I can skips periods but to take a break every 3 months so my body can go through its natural cycle.
9926,I started birth control because my acne is pretty bad and I also experience horrible nausea during my period to a point where I almost throw up.
9927,I also am sexually active and (I use condoms) I want to be really safe and not take any chances so this was a step that I felt was necessary for me as well.
9928,What are some symptoms Im supposed to expect?
9929,"Im 89lbs and I have a very high metabolism, my dad has it to so it runs in my family."
9930,Im not often very hungry so is any of that expected to change?
9931,Im also trans and I heard that Im expected to go up a cup size possibly.
9932,"Anyways, Id just appreciate it if you guys could answer some of my questions and give me your experiences!"

9938,My ftm friend took birth control continuously without taking the placebo to skip his periods too.
9939,"You dont even have to have one every 3 months if you dont want to, birth control periods arent actual cycles."
9940,Theyre just your body withdrawing from the hormones.
9941,I myself was on Alysena for 3 years and saw no difference in boob size or appetite.
9942,Honestly I started Alysena around your age too and just got off of it recently and got Kyleena.
9943,I miss Alysena so much she was my best friend honestly.
9944,"As for body changes, I cant say I noticed much."
9945,I did gain weight but it could be unrelated.
9946,I never took the sugar pills but I skipped a week instead (sugar pills are weird tbh).
9947,Honestly I wish you luck!
9948,Alysena worked SO well for me (I was doing perfect use pretty much) and I wish I could go back lol.
9949,Not even a week on the IUD and I hate it already.
9950,"Happy cake day but also, this morning there was practically no blood or anything."
9951,Is this an effect of the birth control?
9952,"Yup, birth control thins your uterine lining, so sometimes there will be little to no blood"
9953,Hello.I'm sorry if this has been posted before.
9954,I had a baby a little less than 3 months ago.
9955,My first.
9956,I just had my IUD placed on Wednesday and it didn't really hurt at all.
9957,"Thursday just had some light bleeding and cramps but today, Friday I feel awful and very sharp pains on ym right side."
9958,And they're constantly for most of the day.
9959,I find it hard to sit and feed my baby.
9960,Pick up my baby.
9961,Walk and move around the house.
9962,Just very uncomfortable.
9963,The clinic is now closed so I'll have to wait till Monday to call so I just took some tylenol.Has anyone experienced this before?
9964,I'm kinda nervous.
9965,"But no bleeding, fever or chills so I think I'm ok?"

9970,I had that happen and it subsided after a week and a half
9971,Help a girlie out!
9972,"I am getting so frustrated lol moved to the US a year ago and now realizing how hard it is to navigate this When I was in university, my student insurance covered Slynd completely (Aetna)."
9973,"I was getting it through Nurx.I graduated and got a job and took the cheapest insurance available, not realizing it doesn't include prescription medicine."
9974,Nurx was taking forever to respond so I had my prescription transferred to Walgreens.
9975,I found out the copay card Slynd has can't be used because I don't have insurance.
9976,"I sucked it up and paid for one month prescription, costing me 200.I was able to purchase a Kaiser insurance that covers prescription, but Slynd is not part of their formulary so I have to pay."
9977,I asked if I can use my copay card and they said they don't do coupons.
9978,I tried transferring my prescription to Amazon pharmacy and use the copay card.
9979,Still not working.Am I really shit of luck in this?
9980,My plan says female contraceptives are always covered so why is Slynd not covered?
9981,I really love this pill as I get zero side effects and no bleeding so I don't want to change.I'm about halfway through my Slynd pack so any advice helps!
9982,I'm so confused and frustrated  The Kaiser plan was so expensive and if it doesn't work I may just opt out once it's enrollment season.
9983,"I'm sorry you're navigating this, it's so frustrating I know!"
9984,"Believe it or not, this is a huge improvement over when we previously didn't have contraceptives covered."
9985,"I hate it here Slynd is one of those cases like Lo Loestrin where it's name brand only and insurance plans love to, somehow, avoid covering it."
9986,"( After you got the Kaiser plan you mentioned ""they don't take coupons""  was this Walgreens that you asked?"
9987,Because they (the pharmacy) would be the one to make that call.Rereading the savings card document( it mentions if it's not covered you should ask the pharmacist to run it as cashpay and then apply the coupon.
9988,Step 3 on the second page.
9989,Can you try that with your pharmacy?
9990,"And if that does work, maybe you don't even need the prescription insurance plan anymore lol.Failing that somehow, I would maybe call Kaiser and see if they'll cover it if you acquire a Prior Authorization from your doctor.You SHOULD be able to get this affordably one way or another, it's just a huge pain in the ass and intentionally confusing."
9991,I would def try asking about 'cash pay  coupon'.
9992,Hang in there!ETA There is also a phone number on that savings program doc.
9993,It says to call them if you have questions/problems!
9994,Try that too
9995,Slynd has a code on their website that brings the cost down to 25 a month.
9996,"Just google slynd discount code and it should some up, give that code to the pharmacy when you pick it up"

10000,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
10001,"Go with the Slynd code at Walgreens, you will get a month for 25."
10002,It's what I use and I have great insurance.
10003,"Call your medical insurance and get it preapproved, then kaiser should cover it Now, never pay for the cheapest insurance."
10004,Compare plans.
10005,Usually HMOs are a bit more expensive but they cover a lot more and you never know what might happen.
10006,My husband broke his back and what would have been 20K was 250.
10007,"I need surgery for my endometriosis and that was gonna be 10,000."
10008,I paid 0.
10009,We will be having baby hopefully next year.
10010,"The pregnancy, birth, babies appointment will cost us like 300."
10011,"Sure my husband's work had us paying like 500 a month for it, but look how much it saves us when things go bad."
10012,We have the same insurance just now through my employer (union) so we pay like 26 a month now.
10013,Anyways my medical doesn't cover perscription either.
10014,But my medical doctor prescribed it and got pre approval with the perscription insurance now I pay like 28 a for 3 months of Slynd.
10015,THANK YOU.
10016,"I was honestly feeling like I'm just not saying the right keywords so to speak, lol.It was Kaiser pharmacy that said they don't do coupons."
10017,( They said they can run a cash saving program of their own but I would need my dr to give me the prescription.
10018,I'm still currently using my old prescription because I'm still deciding between my luck on getting Slynd.Walgreens on the other hand said that I needed to have prescription insurance before they can apply that coupon.
10019,They were kinda rude so it was so hard for me to ask questions.
10020,"When I went to Walgreens, I didn't have my Kaiser plan yet, just the smartMEC basic plan with no prescription coverage."
10021,Dont give up!
10022,I had to try 3 different pharmacies before I found a super sweet tech at a walgreens who knew what she was doing.
10023,She got it dropped it down to 80 for 3 months with the manufacturers coupon and I have no insurance!
10024,"Oh not at all, they make it super confusing like this on purpose."
10025,It is very deliberate and you're not doing anything wrong!It is very hard to ask questions and push when they're being rude but unfortunately sometimes that's your only option to get results.
10026,I have a hard time with confrontation and I feel you.
10027,"I think I would try Walgreens or another retail pharmacy like that again with the steps I listed.One more thing I wanted to add, you should be able to get a free sample pack to buy you another month!"
10028,I literally just did this myself earlier this week.
10029,"You can click ""connect with our doctors"" on this page on My Pill and More( and fill everything out."
10030,Slynd has their own prescribing platform (it used to be linked directly on their site) and you'll see the Slynd branding when you go through that form.So you can go there and request Slynd.
10031,They'll ask you for an address for where to send the sample and you should get a text after a few days saying it shipped (they give a tracking number too).
10032,Good luck!
10033,Hi all!
10034,I had my Kyleena IUD removed a few weeks ago and thought Id share my experience.
10035,"Prior to getting an IUD, Id been on a few different birth control pills for about 6 years."
10036,"I have PCOS and my periods have always been irregular, heavy and very painful."
10037,My doctor suggested the IUD in 2018 and I decided to try it.
10038,I had the IUD put in October 2018.
10039,Per my OBGYNs recommendation I took two ibuprofen about an hour before my appointment because she said insertion may cause some pain.
10040,"I didnt have pain during the insertion, just pressure."
10041,I did have cramps for a few hours after but that was all.
10042,In the 5 years that I had the IUD I never had a period or spotting.
10043,I had the IUD removed august 23rd because I was coming up on the 5 year mark and also decided I was ready to try for a baby.
10044,"The removal, like the insertion, was not at all painful, I felt a slight pinch and it was done."
10045,"5 days after removal, on 8/28, I had some brown spotting but it only lasted two days."
10046,"My period returned on 9/14, 3 weeks after removal."
10047,Im very thankful to have had a positive experience and would definitely use the Kyleena again in the future when Im ready to go back on birth control.

10052,Hello!
10053,I had a very similar experience although I had my kyleena for 3 years and removed on September 8th since my husband and I have decided to TTC.
10054,My period arrived just as expected when I was on my IUD so it seems like my body was never really effected negatively on the IUD.
10055,Both insertion and removal were a breeze!Good luck on your baby journey!
10056,Glad to hear another positive experience!
10057,Good luck to you on your baby journey as well!
10058,"i am currently on tri sprintec and me and my boyfriend had sex with no condom, in the middle of it he put a condom on so he could finish."
10059,we have considered going to no condom and only pullout.
10060,how safe is it and is it a big risk?
10061,should i be worried about pregnancy with what happened tonight?
10062,"the pill is designed with the assumption that your partner is finishing inside, so theres no risk"
10063,Depends on how well you take your pill.
10064,I always say 2 forms of birth control  pulling out does count.
10065,Birth control is 99 effective when taken consistently at the same time
10066,I have an IUD and make my boyfriend pull out.
10067,Im not taking any risk

10071,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
10072,"If ur taking ur contraception exactly how its ment to be and dont miss any, dont have diarrhoea or throw up in the few hours after taking ur pill then you are protected and pulling out in this case would be a second method of contraception on top."
10073,As long as you you take it when ur ment to and ur all good you would be protected to have raw sex where you have semen inside you at the end
10074,i dont have to worry about precum?
10075,i take it perfect same time every night besides once about every six months lol i forget to take one like last week or two weeks ago i forgot to take my pill until the next morning (abt 13 hrs later) but i read its not considered late until 24 hrs later for combo pill
10076,Ive been a Boston cream donut for the last 3 years with mine and I still have no children to speak of lol
10077,"Girl I got turned into a twinkie multiple times a day for a month, Im on the pill."
10078,If that doesnt say that the pills work I dont know what will.
10079,"I understand if this is the first time and you are nervous, it is hard to understand how a pill so small can do so much.You are protected."
10080,"And it doesnt matter how much you have condomless sex, you will still have the same amount of protection every time ."
10081,Its what the pills do
10082,No.
10083,He can FULLY cum inside 10 times a day if you guys wanted.
10084,That's THE WHOLE POINT of birth control.
10085,As long as you take it correctly and on time you are protected.
10086,no youre protected by your pill
10087,"You are probably really safe anyway you want to do it including no condom or pullout at all but if you want to be super sure, you'll be fine with just pulloutbc pill."
10088,Condom would only be necessary if you feel there is some other reason to use it or it relieves anxiety you might have about failure.
10089,"As long as you dont leave it in excessive heat, take meds that interact with it, if you vomit/have diarrhea within 3 hours of taking it it counts as a missed pill."
10090,Other than that should be good.
10091,"thank you for that it comforts me a lot, i just have to learn to trust it more."
10092,what did you do if you missed a pill?
10093,a week ago i was 13 hours late on the pill before i took it.
10094,did you change anything you did like you more protection or anything?
10095,should i not worry about it if im ever late on a pill?
10096,im on the combo pill
10097,Wooooo cum party
10098,"If youre on the combo pill, that counts as a late pill."
10099,So as long as you took it when you remembered and then took your next pill at the normal time you were still protected.
10100,A missed pill on the combo pill is two in a row.
10101,"Your protection was never badly compromised.Also even if you were worried about that, then after 7 days (8th) pill youre protected again.If I missed two pills in a row, yes I would either abstain or use condoms."
10102,And the combo pill has a 12 hour window.
10103,So if you take it at 12pm you have until 12am to take it
10104,"Hi, my girlfriend (21) and I (22) had unprotected sex about a month ago near the end of her period, but I didnt finish inside her."
10105,"About 12 hours later, she took plan B."
10106,"Recently, shes been peeing often and having a runny nose."
10107,Her period shouldve been around this time but hasnt come around yet.
10108,She took a pregnancy test just earlier today in the afternoon and it came back negative.
10109,Am I just being paranoid or is she pregnant?
10110,"A test is definitive three weeks after sex, shes not pregnant."
10111,The test wouldve detected it by now so she isnt pregnant.

10137,Hi guys!
10138,A recent visit with my Obgyn help ease my (21) mind a little bit on birth control.
10139,Im feeling like the ring or patch are best fit for me (at least to what the doctor was saying and describing it) but I wanted to know your guys opinions and experiences on it.
10140,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.

10143,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
10144,I can speak for a path here but I been very happy with it!
10145,Been almost 10 months now and got very mild side effect or completely nothing!
10146,"My bleeds got regular, I would have some cramping a week before my withdrawal bleeding but its not so painful as it was before I started bc."
10147,"No weight gain, no mood swings, no depression."
10148,"Although, every body is different and my experience might not match how your body reacts, I would still say that patch is a good choice."
10149,One side note would be that you gotta be mindful with water.
10150,"Showers are okay, but if you take baths or swim  its possible it might peel off and if that happens you need to put new one, but overall, if you keep an eye out, its not so bad"
10151,I love the ring.
10152,I have annovera and I never have to worry about any sort of daily or monthly management at all (I leave it in year round).
10153,I have sex with it in and don't feel it.My biggest side effects are low libido and harder to climax.
10154,The low libido works well for my partner who is much more aligned to this frequency vs when I'm not on birth control.
10155,"It's already hard for me to climax, so that part really sucks."
10156,I've also had two yeast infections since starting on the ring over a year ago (doubling the number I've had in my lifetime).
10157,Both were fairly mild.
10158,"As I got closer to the end of the first one, it would not stay up inside me  it didn't fall out but I had to constantly push it back in."
10159,"When I got the new one, you could see how stretched it had gotten after a year of use comparatively."
10160,I started taking the pill for the very first time (Gedarel) about 16 months ago (I am 23).
10161,"I gained a little weight, but i also just got into a new relationship at this time which I know can cause that to happen as well."
10162,"For the last 3 months, though, I have been doing everything I can to try and lose a bit of weight but nothing is working."
10163,"I reduced calories, changed the types of foods I was eating to be proteinheavy and light on everything else, lots of veggies etc., I exercise for 45min1hr every day, hardly ever drink alcohol, have even cut out lattes and stuck just to tea."
10164,"After 3 months in with almost 100 consistency, I have lost 1kg and actual measurements have gone down a clothing size (from UK 10 to 8, US 6 to 4)."
10165,"any other time in my life this much dedication would have made a huge difference.I have been so frustrated, really don't know what more I can do, and a friend suggested to me today that it may be because I am on hormonal birth control."
10166,"Has anyone else had this problem, and was it attributed to hormonal birth control?"
10167,"if so, did changing pills get rid of the problem, or did you have to stop taking it altogether?"
10168,I never lost the weight I gained on the pill until I got off of it.
10169,"Most of it is water weight which is hard to get rid of, so even if you are losing body fat it might not be noticeable because your body is retaining water."
10170,Getting off the pill was the only thing that helped me and made a noticeable difference.
10171,"Different pills have different effects when it comes to weight, talk to the doctor who gave you the prescription about your concern."
10172,I gained 10lbs on BC and now Im losing that weight slowly but surely.
10173,I recommend r/loseit for inspiration/support

10180,I do gain boob weight though (at least I have that).
10181,Have you tried different types of pills?
10182,Monophasic vs triphasic?
10183,And lower vs higher hormones?

10185,Also more cardio maybe?
10186,"When I came off the pill after ten years I lost 2 stone in the space of a few months, I didnt change anything, I was already on a fairly balanced diet with regular exercise."
10187,"So Im wearing my patch on my arm this week, and I accidentally spayed perfume directly on my patch as Im wearing a tank top and I was aiming towards my collarbone / chest and totally missed."
10188,"I change my patch in 2 days anyways, do we think its okay?"
10189,Or is it gonna mess with hormones/efficacy?
10190,"It should be fine, the medication is in the adhesive."
10191,You are completely fine!
10192,The top is glossy for that exact reason.
10193,It wont effect hormones or anything serious like that so you have nothing to worry about.
10194,You dont have to change it and can freely change it on your change day
10195,Yes this is what I came to say as well!
10196,"The top of the patch comes in contact with all kinds of stuff (body wash, shampoo, water, dirt, etc.)"
10197,As long as the adhesive wasnt compromised it should be fine.
10198,Hello everyone.
10199,Last year when I went to get my iud removed and replaced with a new one I had 6 years with it.
10200,I was told I didnt have to remove it until this year because it was good for 7 years now.
10201,Im seeing different posts that say its good for 8 years now.
10202,Is it 7 or 8?
10203,I had mines inserted Oct of 2016.
10204,"Its good for 8 it says so on the mirena website, fda approved."
10205,I got mine 2018 so Im good til 2026.
10206,2016 so youre good til 2024 next year

10223,Hi everyone.
10224,"I'm a 22 y/o female, sexually active (same partner, no protection) with a Kyleena IUD.Almost 2 years ago, I got my first pap smear."
10225,It came back abnormal.
10226,"I went for a follow up maybe 8 months later, it was normal."
10227,My doctor wanted 2 consecutive normal tests before sending me back to regular 35 yrs screenings.
10228,I got another pap done 8 months later this past August and it once again came back abnormal.
10229,The result said atypical squamous cells on unidentified significance.
10230,Has anyone ever had this happen?
10231,I'm vaccinated against HPV and am scared I have it or that I'm at risk of cervical cancer.
10232,"Are there ways to contract HPV that aren't sex, and other reasons to explain the 2 abnormal paps despite a normal one in the middle?Any advice would be appreciated, I'm really scared."
10233,"At this stage theyre catching whatever your issue is before its cancer, thats good."
10234,"Only the doctor can tell you if its HPV (Im not sure if they can test it on paps, but can definitely test if you have a biopsy).I was in a similar situation and needed a procedure done to remove the cells."
10235,No issues since.
10236,"Thats why you do your Pap smears when the doctor says, you catch problems when you can manage it.Most people have HPV."

10240,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
10241,"Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance means that some of your cervical cells are not normal, but it's not clear whether HPV is the cause."
10242,Source  Another infection or changes in hormone levels can cause this result.
10243,"Often the doctor would order an HPV test after this result, but ask your own doctor which followup tests, if any, you need."
10244,"Most abnormal cells clear up on their own, even those caused by HPV."
10245,"It's very rare to develop cervical cancer if you get screened regularly, and even cervical cancer caught early is very treatable."
10246,"If you were vaccinated before you ever had sex, the vaccine is very effective against the strains of HPV that can cause cancer, but there are several strains that the vaccine doesn't cover because they are considered low risk."
10247,"HPV is transmitted through sex, but that includes oral and genitaltogenital contact without penetration  so people who consider themselves virgins can have HPV."
10248,It's also important to know that routine STI tests don't look for HPV.
10249,I normally keep my pills at home but I have been traveling the last week.
10250,Its been hot where Ive been.
10251,We keep the air conditioning in the car on and I keep my pills in my purse so when I go in somewhere they dont sit in the car.
10252,"However, I stupidly left my purse in the car when we got out to go look at a scenic overlook."
10253,I was out of the car for no more than 30 minutes.
10254,The pills were in my purse under the back seat (not in direct sun).
10255,It was in the upper 80s like 87F that day.
10256,Do you think my pills are okay or ruined?
10257,Not sure what to do.
10258,Thanks )
10259,"This might help you figure out?Sorry I couldnt get the link thing to work on the app, but pretty much one of the things it says is pills can last up to 4 days in 104f weather."
10260,And it also shows signs of the pill being slightly compromised just in case you also need that also.If you have any concerns please call your pharmacist or message the people where you order your birth control from so that way they can answer any questions you have.
10261,Its better to be safe than sorry and I feel like this is more of a pharmacist question than a Reddit question
10262,Just watch the coloration on your pills.
10263,If they start to look weird in color or texture I would toss them out.
10264,I would also toss them if the package looks like the heat affected it.
10265,Typically the dont keep in heat warnings seem to mean dont use your car as the storage location.
10266,I like to camp a lot.
10267,One weekend I was camping (4 days) the real feel outside was 110 average all 4 days.
10268,My pills were fine.
10269,I also travel a lot and sometimes my pills will sit in the car for an hour or 2 and they've always been fine!
10270,Just be cautious but you're safe!

10296,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
10297,Just seen an influencer on ig saying that she believes her struggle with infertility was because she was previously on the pill and so many people commented comments such as did yall not learn prolonged bc use leads to infertility like no?
10298,thats totally not true?I see another one saying that when someone says theyre not gonna get pregnant since they are on bc she just smiles and lets them believe their delusions like?
10299,i get there is a chance but that chance is low LOW?
10300,especially with good/perfect use.
10301,preventing pregnancy is literally no1 reason why people even use bc.
10302,"ive seen countless such influencers, mainly white christian moms preaching against it and how evil it is."
10303,i dont believe in bc i will have as many children as god gives me good for u but stop manifesting and promoting nonsense and literal harmful misinformation to masses.
10304,there is enough anxiety around this topic as it is.
10305,"get ur information from legit websites like planned parenthood, read some peer reviewed articles or ask a trusted ob/gyn."
10306,and im not saying pregnancy never happens on bc or that there arent any possible side effects but cmon.
10307,it pisses me off so bad fr.
10308,Medical misinformation on the internet especially regarding women's health is rampant.
10309,It truly is difficult because our sex education is so poor and then people come into the office armed with TikTok knowledge and do not listen to my recommendations or explanations.
10310,It's really disheartening and has led to a lot of burn out.
10311,Like what's the point of 12 years of education and training only to be told I'm wrong by a 25 year old TikTok influencer
10312,Agreed!
10313,And then people believe it and come here and post asking if what they saw is true or or not.
10314,"""I saw it on TikTok so it must be true mentality..."""
10315,It is disturbing and it's part of a wider trend of backlash against women's rights in general.
10316,"I think a lot of it is basically astroturfing( and these influencers have a pretty transparent conservative and antifeminist agenda, but I also think that they're taking advantage of a very real and valid mistrust that women have of the medical establishment."
10317,Female reproductive health is understudied and misunderstood and mainstream medicine has been incredibly dismissive of women's pain and concerns because we live in a patriarchal society.
10318,There's a lot of misinformation out there too because of restrictions on sex education and taboos.
10319,It really scares me how easy it is for these people to lie about something so important.
10320,I saw a tiktok about using contraceptives to skip your periods and everyone in the comments was all ahhhh!!!
10321,That's so bad for your body and Ahhh!
10322,that will cause infertility and can even lead to death!!
10323,"!Like, what?"
10324,Same reason theyre wanting a National abortion ban in the US.
10325,"Birth rates, especially among white women, are dropping."
10326,Birth control has always been their next target.
10327,They have had miniconferences dedicated to this strategy.
10328,"Not to mention, you cant prove BC causes infertility after usage if you havent been already tested for infertility, PRIOR."
10329,You could literally have fertility issues prior to use and not have known at all.
10330,I think the only acceptable form of this is just venting about your experiences so people have a safe space to also debrief with other folks who have gone through something similar.
10331,However that does not include claiming absolutely incorrect things like about fertility or effectiveness.
10332,"Like yeah, lets talk about acne or periods or how your libido changed, but lets not act like we have a medical degree."
10333,Literally.
10334,"So many of these ""holistic"" influencers swear off birth control and it's so frustrating."
10335,"The pill is the only thing that has helped my cystic, hormonal acne."
10336,Its the confidence that gets me.
10337,This is the kind of misinformation that kept me from going on BC for years because I was so scared of it.
10338,"Suffered through years of pregnancy scares, PMDD, crippling cramps because of rhetoric that BC was ""unnatural"" and therefore dangerous."
10339,"The pill has changed my life for the better, physically and mentally."
10340,I really wish the BC fearmongering on social media would stop
10341,Lots of anti birth control propaganda in the media rn.
10342,"People, and especially women who believe in the out of context data these influencers provide don't understand how harmful this is in the long run."
10343,Anti BC talk will eventually make it easier to take away yet another big part of women's reproductive rights.
10344,Unfortunately the general public doesn't understand that and keeps supporting misinformation...
10345,I agree and its not just white Christian moms but these influencers that claim to specialize in female health as well.
10346,They always seem to have the whole blonde or brunette body wave thing going on and look perfectly polished too.
10347,Like I find it enraging how entitled these girls are like birth control was a trajectory changing invention for women.
10348,"AFAIK idiots have been thinking using long term bc makes you less fertile or whatever, it's not new, in guessing people just have more of a reach to get these dumb ideas out to others"
10349,Omg!
10350,I noticed a lot of these influencers are also pretending to be all natural and encourage natural remedies as birth control which is so unethical.
10351,Part of me believes theyre being paid off by conservative Christian companies to spread misinformation
10352,There was some time back this strange thing on tiktok of them removing their own IUDs ..like what ..
10353,This came up in conversation yesterday with someone saying she is sure her ectopic was due to this.
10354,"No, its not."
10355,I think external factors relating to how we live now and our different stresses are impacting our ability to get pregnant earlier.
10356,"I saw one about how much the creator of the vid loved her period and was so in sync with her body, implying that those on bc are not in sync with theirs."
10357,that one kinda got to me for a while
10358,"As someone who got pregnant even before my first cycle after stopping the pill 3 weeks after my wedding and 10 years of continued useIts not the pill causing infertility, in many woman going through fertility treatments it actually helps."
10359,"Did I have an awful pregnancy, absolutely!"
10360,"Did it result in a micropreemie, yup!"
10361,"It wasnt the pills fault though, it was preeclampsia and that can affect anyone of any culture during pregnancy with or without birth control."
10362,SO many woman like myself want to place a blame on things they cannot control.
10363,Birth control is not the thing to point the finger at.
10364,"I agree, it's very dangerous to spread that info especially when women in the US don't have a CHOICE to be on birth control."
10365,omg agree!
10366,It does happen in rare cases.
10367,My mom was on prolonged bc and instantly got pregnant with me once she stopped.
10368,But her identical twin sister was also on prolonged bc and took her a few years before she got pregnant and both her boys ended up being preemies.
10369,"It does happen, but not always.ETA I wasn't a preemie and was a healthy big baby when I was born."
10370,This!!
10371,Recently Ive seen so many people also talking about why birth control ruined their life for years but all physicians literally say that side effects to birth control are as unique as the person taking them!
10372,I hate seeing women preaching why birth control is bad and why no one should be on it.
10373,Having sex while being on birth control seems to feel like its now unsafe sex due to all this misinformation.
10374,Influencers just seem to be pushing this no birth control agenda and it sounds like theyre just encouraging irresponsible sexual health practices.
10375,"i just wanna talk about  the part you referenced someone saying i will have as many children as god gives meif that person even just uses the pullout method and no contraception at all, they are not having as many children as god gives them."
10376,"if a fertile person doesnt use any contraception or the pullout method, theyre gonna have A LOT of kids"

10385,I talked to a nurse about it and she told me it was totally okay and fine for me.
10386,I finally got a family doctor and he freaked out when he saw that I was on it.
10387,And switched me to a new b.c pill.
10388,"And I add this just for content, I don't smoke, I'm fit, but he made it sound like I was taking poison."
10389,I hate this new pill (I keep getting nauseous) and I'm trying to find a new doctor so I can switch back.
10390,I should've gone with my gut and argued with him.
10391,"So yeah, it isn't just the influencers..."
10392,My mom keeps saying she things Ill struggle with fertility because Im on the pill as her cousin was on birth control for years and was unable to have kids.
10393,I really hate hearing that as there are a lot of people whove gotten pregnant after going off birth control.
10394,Hell it even happened to one of my cousins as her youngest was unplanned as she stopped taking birth control as she thought she didnt need it anymore then all of a sudden she was pregnant.
10395,Yeah its pretty dangerous spreading misinformation like that.
10396,"I mean, theres definitely a lack of research in womens health and most symptoms we end up complaining about are told its from stress or because were women."
10397,Feels like nothings being done.
10398,"Anyway, while stuff like this is super damaging and not true, researchers need to start actually caring about women and our health."
10399,Im diagnosed with PMDD and my only option (the only one thats worked for me) is being on yaz.
10400,It saved my life a few years back.
10401,Some women have to be on bc.
10402,Some dont and have the option but its up to each woman to decide whats best for them and we shouldnt have to put up with other women shaming our choices.
10403,Why cant women just support other women  Also I grew up in a church.. just try and ignore the white Christian moms.
10404,Heads are so far up their asses.
10405,They love to make others feel guilty
10406,I appreciate you!
10407,Keep your head up!
10408,Youre a big deal.
10409,The education you go through is astounding I appreciate that you did it and you continue to try.
10410,Fight the good fight
10411,Its not just influencers causing it.
10412,Took me 11 years to get the treatment I needed and wanted because OBGYNs ignored and mistreated me as a chronic pelvic pain/heavy bleeding patient.
10413,Spent the majority of my teens and early 20s a shell of myself because of the recommended meds they gave me.
10414,"I lost a lot of respect and trust in healthcare in general, and gained a LOT of trauma from gynecological care."
10415,"Finally found a great doctor that did my hysterectomy and I feel like I have control over my body again for the first time in all 13 years of suffering, after being told nonexistent kids and husbands had more power over my body than I did."
10416,"I know there are good doctors still out there, but Ive met more horrible OBGYNs than good ones IME."
10417,Not all us patients are stupid or naive either.
10418,My Masters program allowed me to read peer reviewed literature and reference it in my quest to find real freaking help that wasnt just antidepressants and chemical menopauseinducing meds.
10419,"My endocrine system will never be the same, and I cry for the person I shouldve been had I not been dismissed and told Im crazy for over a decade."
10420,This is becoming a huge problem in every medicallyadjacent subreddit Ive seen.
10421,"Misinformation medicine is RAMPANT on social media, and it has somehow made everyone loose all sense of just because its on the internet doesnt mean its true."
10422,this!
10423,i cant believe how many people convince themselves tiktok is a credible source of info like?
10424,This.
10425,Holistic and/or conservative influencers pushing hormonal birth control is bad for you so when the time comes to chip away rights to BC the populace will be none the wiser.
10426,It's like free advertising.
10427,"I mean the only way that would be possible is if you have that rare genetic disorder where you have an iron overload, but even then it could be managed other ways lol"
10428,"Damn, I've been doing it for like 10 years."
10429,I'm surprised I haven't died
10430,Vatican propaganda strikes again.
10431,this is so disgusting and is really just about wanting to have control over women and our bodies
10432,100 suffered through infertility my entire time TTC.
10433,I was 23.
10434,"""It could be the birth control!!!"""
10435,You say.
10436,Except I'd never been on it.
10437,Well.
10438,For 2 months at 18 but I was so nauseous I got right back off.
10439,So prime example of infertility without birth control.I got birth control after my first and infertility when trying again.
10440,Definitely wasnt the birth control but if I hadnt had it the first time I might not know that.
10441,I used the depo provera from age 14yo20yo.
10442,And then religiously took the combined oral contraceptive pill from 20yo24yo.
10443,"I once went over two years without having a period, it was glorious."
10444,And then I decided to have babies and I was lucky enough to get 3 healthy ones who were all conceived the first or only time we didn't take measures to prevent them.
10445,Birth control is a fucking beautiful thing.
10446,"It's not perfect and it definitely makes my depression about 50 worse, but an unwanted pregnancy as a teenager would've made me end it all, so I'll take my little sadness pills daily and be grateful I don't have to be pregnant every year like many of our recent female ancestors wereside note I've read some journal writings by women who lived before birth control was available."
10447,"They really, really hated having no control over being pregnant all the time."
10448,"For many of them, being forced into having repeated pregnancies and having very few options (due to husbands and their libido, and also due to many women quietly dabbling in sex work to provide for their families."
10449,It was a lot more common than we want to think)  had a major negative effect on the way they felt about their existing children and I can't blame them
10450,Only thing that makes me a functioning human with endometriosis
10451,studied have shown that there is no significant difference in percentage of women that werent previously on bc and tried to conceive and percentage of women who were previously on bc within a year.
10452,In both cases around 8085 of women concieved.
10453,"Also pill induced PCOS is not true PCOS, it happens because of serge of the androgen."
10454,It is usually cleared in about 46 months.
10455,"I totally believe in your experience and it is valid, but i also believe that the issues we experience after coming off bc (and the possible impact on fertility) are a lot more complex."
10456,"Also my main point was that even in the slim chance of actual infertility caused by bc, there is no need to advocate and scare people against bc at all."
10457,People that do that on social media are usually misinformed and uneducated fear mongers.
10458,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge.Women fall pregnant at the same rate whether previously on hormonal birth control or not (FAM)."
10459,I was on BC for 5 years...
10460,Took it perfectly.
10461,"First time I got it on with my now husband (with a condom and still taking my contraceptive), we still managed to get pregnant."
10462,That was a combo pill.Now I take Slynd and forego the condom and no new pregnancies.
10463,Contraceptives are weird.
10464,Exactly.
10465,Just because it's rare doesn't mean it doesn't happen in the rarest of cases.
10466,"I mean, it's true?"
10467,"You don't have any period at all on hbc, just a withdrawal bleed, and it suppresses your body's natural hormonal fluctuations and cycle."
10468,The point of hbc is to stop natural processes like ovulation from occurring.
10469,I think most of us who were or are on hbc don't love their period.
10470,"But yeah, a healthy period is often called the fifth vital sign that is an indicator of other health issues and hbc takes that away."
10471,"Most women are extremely fertile as soon as you stop the pill, so just wanted to say that here."
10472,I dont know how long that window lasts.
10473,But something many gynos tell you to take into consideration.
10474,"i will not dismiss your aunts experience and i feel for her, but i do believe its highly unlikely birth control usage was the cause."
10475,its much more likely that she already had underlying fertility issues or other things that impacted her fertility and simply didnt know (also due to the fact that bc often masks these symptoms).
10476,"Infertility is medically defined as being unable to conceive for more than a year, but after stopping bc it may take women some time to conceive since their hormone levels are still unbalanced."
10477,some need more time than others and some women conceive right away.
10478,generally it was studied and concluded that hormonal bc doesnt impact infertility and neither do non hormonal methods.
10479,i will link this article  in case u wanted to dive deeper into what i just summed up
10480,i genuinely dont know whats so improperly spelled btw english is literally my third language also idk how is that of any relevance to the topic?
10481,but thank you for your imput ig
10482,im on yaz and it has been alright with me!
10483,So sorry this happened to you.
10484,I sympathize!
10485,Lots of issues with doctors over the years.
10486,I finally came off the pill last year and was having terrible symptoms 2 months later and the gyno at PP I saw said that after the pill leaves your body in about 48 hours it's not possible to have any side effects.
10487,I don't think she knows anything about hormones which is terrifying.
10488,"As a millennial, I definitely remember hearing ""don't believe everything you see on the internet."""
10489,"Now it seems like those same boomers are the ones who believe everything on the internet and nothing that ""experts"" say."
10490,"I don't even have a TikTok account, but I know enough to stay away from it."
10491,"It's stems from an ""elite"" (read anyone highly educated) backlash a certain subset of the population has bought into."
10492,"Denial of climate change and undermining scientists (since it got to the point that over 90 of scientists agreed climate change is real) was a major cause IMO, but it's certainly not the only source.If you can't trust the real experts, who does that leave?"
10493,Internet nut jobs.
10494,Going on 5 years now.
10495,"Also had multiple covid vaccines, get a yearly flu shot, up to date on everything else."
10496,"Still not dead, no extra limbs or super powers."
10497,"It happens more often than people think, thats why studies that show infertility after bc can be unreliable if people werent tested prior."
10498,Im so sorry to hear you had a tough time with infertility though!
10499,Im sure it wasnt easy.
10500,Hoping the best for you.
10501,"Thank you for correcting this.I'd also like to point out that that the ""rebound"" people get after quitting the pill or getting a hormonal IUD removed can often just be what your ""natural"" period is like."
10502,"I had a long term relationship that began when I was a teen end so I just stopped taking the pill when my prescription ran out, figuring there was no reason to take it anymore."
10503,Wrong!
10504,I then remembered that every period used to be that debilitating until I got on the pill.
10505,"It had been making a huge difference, I just forgot."
10506,Yes I have endometriosis with the pill or not.
10507,Is it likely that my endometriosis will affect my fertility?
10508,Yes.
10509,Has my pill masked the symptoms?
10510,Yes.
10511,"It was there before, it will be there after."
10512,"My birth control is not affecting my fertility, my endometriosis and FVL are."
10513,Exactly.
10514,No evidence that those people wouldnt have had fertility issues with or without bc.
10515,It was just the tone and like the spiritual undertones of it that like sat with me.
10516,"she was telling the truth, the bleeding on the pill is not a period"
10517,It definitely depends on the woman.
10518,Had a friend discover she had endometriosis after stopping birth control because the symptoms werent really present while on hormones.
10519,Could NOT get pregnant without help.
10520,Took her 5 years of procedures  fertility treatments but she has 2 beautiful healthy children today.
10521,"I think the thing about getting pregnant  and having a baby is, it will happen when you need it most, not when you always want it."
10522,"At least in my experience, my girl was the biggest blessing I never knew I needed."
10523,Her Dr was the one who told her it was from her bc.
10524,My mom's Dr also told her to be aware that it could take a few months or so before she would get pregnant due to being on bc since they first started their periods.
10525,Both my Aunt and my Mom had heavy and painful periods to the point they were prescribed bc to help with it.
10526,"But your comment is dismissing the fact that it is rare in my family's case, it was due to the bc."
10527,I know more about my family history than you do.
10528,My mom's side of the family is extremely open about their health issues so all of us can tell our Dr's about all of our family history.
10529,"Just because it's rare, doesn't mean it doesn't happen.ETA I also have the heavy painful periods and started my period at the same age as my Aunt and they started a year apart."
10530,My mom started hers at 13 and my Aunt started at 14.
10531,My mom asked me when I started if I wanted to be on bc to help and I said no but eventually got on bc once I became sexually active.
10532,Right???
10533,I always really liked it.
10534,I hate this new pill.
10535,Anyways sorry for going on a rant.
10536,But I completely agree with you on influencers.
10537,It's really bad when they give medical or diet advice.
10538,"I don't even think half of it is real, I think they're just getting payed."
10539,"The doctor that put in my Mirena swore up and down, even laughed when I told her I was having horrible side effects from it, that it was local only and couldnt possibly cause side effects."
10540,Mirena is what ultimately put me on the journey to yeet everything but the ovaries.
10541,I refused to go through more meds after that.
10542,"Im a brand new person now and its only been a few days post op, wild how I happened to know exactly what I wanted as a patientIm getting a picture of it in a biopsy jar to smack staff with for the inevitable are you sure youre not pregnant justincase tests that cost me a tank of gas every time."
10543,Thats my only regret is that theyll still never believe me!
10544,Its just the internet.
10545,People have this specific obsession with tiktok but will use Reddit just the same.
10546,"This is an issue of gullible people who lack the capacity to think critically and fact check, which has been an issue across all social media.However, I do think tiktok is a little more influential because youre hearing these stories directly from the people they allegedly happened to, so you really do just have to be aware that the internet is a shit hole any time you engage."
10547,Entirely on you.
10548,this!
10549,Ahh well I sympathize there.
10550,I don't do the woo woo stuff either and anyone who says they like their period is sus
10551,I have endometriosis and my symptoms were exacerbated times 100000 after going off of the pill.
10552,But it made me suicidal.
10553,TikTok is a cesspool of stupid information but the truth is the pill is not a one size fits all for every person and everything.
10554,"My periods ruin my life every month, and I would go on the pill tomorrow if I didnt have so many horrible side effects."
10555,Ive never tried to get pregnant but I guess well see if I ever attempt
10556,"Heavy, painful periods are often the main symptoms of endometriosis."
10557,The treatment is birth control.
10558,Seeing your mom and her twin have heavy painful period from early teens and you as well I would bet money it's endometriosis.
10559,1 in 10 women have it and it can affect fertility.
10560,"It is incredibly hard to get doctors to take heavy, painful periods seriously."
10561,Average from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 11 Years.
10562,Mine took 14.
10563,"I would ask has you, your aunt or mom had a diagnostic explatory laparoscopic surgery looking for it?"
10564,"Because ultra sounds, ct and mri miss it."
10565,"If the doctor didn't consider that a potential in your aunts fertility issues or any other woman in your family with those symptoms, they need a new one."
10566,Especially if your mom and aunts symptoms have gotten better or gone with menopause.Edit Your aunt having her babies is another common effect of endometriosis..
10567,as i said my point is not to dismiss their experiences and i truly feel for them.
10568,"i still stand behind what i commented, but also acknowledge the possibility i and all these studies could be wrong, but so could be the doc."
10569,"im thinking rationally and as i commented on another users comment, my main point of the post was empathising uneducated and misinformed so called influencers that try to discourage women from practicing safe sex with completely irrelevant and wrong info."
10570,That's evil.
10571,Congrats on the surgery!!
10572,I may go that route eventually.
10573,I think my worst experience was a cardiologist who said I just had anxiety.
10574,Ended up being intermittent SVT.
10575,Perfectly said
10576,Im SO sorry you have to deal with that awful condition especially as horrible as it sounds during your monthly period.
10577,I hope you find relief from it someday.
10578,I got pregnant once and never want to do it again.
10579,There was never anything glowing about it for me.
10580,Other friends LOVE being pregnant and I think they are delusional on their hormone highs lol.
10581,I still stand that everyone's body reacts differently to bc so one may have issues conceiving off it and other's may not.
10582,Everyone has their own personal experience with bc and any other form of medications.
10583,It's not misinformation when you yourself are the 1 person that it effects.
10584,Anxiety is just modern societys new word for hysteria I swear.
10585,"If you ever decide to go yeeting organs, check out the various lists for docs that do tubals no questions asked."
10586,Thats how me and my friend found ours!
10587,So Ive been on TriSprintec for over a year now.
10588,"I mainly went on it because after a couple bad sexual experiences and having to take Plan B, my hormones were fucked."
10589,"Ive never had any bad side effects from it, and honestly I would say Ive been doing BETTER since Ive been taking it."
10590,It really stabilized me and calmed me down.
10591,"However recently, Ive been feeling weirdly numb emotionally and Ive lost my sex drive and can barely get wet, whereas I used to be a waterfall pretty much."
10592,"Tmi, but its true."
10593,"Im also like, very anxious and on edge and Im not sure why."
10594,I did miss 2 pills because I was spending the night away from home and my dumb ass forgot my pill pack.
10595,"I did take them all as soon as I got my pills (so I took 2, and then one later that day to be back on schedule) and I have a boyfriend but we havent had penetrative sex yet (this is the first actual relationship both of us have been in and we both have some trauma due to sex so we are taking things slow) so the pregnancy risk wasnt there anyway."
10596,Im wondering if Im suddenly experiencing side effects due to that or if Im just suddenly having a negative effect from the pill?
10597,"I really dont like the way Im feeling and its like, a switch has flipped and its making me question if I should stop taking them but Im also scared of not taking them."
10598,How long ago were the missed pills?
10599,Maybe it could be from that.
10600,But you can develop delayed side effects from hbc.
10601,I came off mine due to that (migraines) but I lost my wetness after 6 ish years on the same pill (and got it back within 1 wk of quitting hbc).
10602,If it continues I think you may need a different one.

10607,I missed Sunday and Monday.
10608,I took them both on Tuesday and then took my pills regularly from then.
10609,"It sucks big time because my relationship is long distance, and while we do see each other very frequently, (about every 23 weeks) my boyfriend was coming down to visit and it really sucked because I couldnt get as wet, if at all, even though my mind was ready to go."
10610,I usually have a fairly high sex drive but Ive noticed in the past few weeks even before the missed pills its been getting seemingly lower and Im not sure why except for the pill potentially causing it.
10611,My placebo week is coming up the week after next and Im wondering if I should go off of them after that and see if it makes me feel any differently.
10612,"I'm sorry, that is definitely a bummer."
10613,I think you can go off to see if it helps as long as you're comfortable with other prevention methods.
10614,Is there any negative effect to going off of it?
10615,"Like if I go off of them for a bit to see if anything changes and then decide I want to try another pill, do I have to wait any certain amount of time before going back on one?"
10616,"No, you can restart right away if you decide."
10617,There can be side effects coming off just like there are side effects that you can have going on.
10618,"Some will have none and some may have mood swings, fatigue etc."
10619,"Some people get their libido back instantly, others need months."
10620,I got my wetness back within a week.
10621,I forgot what it was like after so many years on the pill lol
10622,"So Ive been off of hormonal BC for over two years now due to trying just about every method out there besides an IUD and having migraines, weight gain, severe depression, and of course the worst one for me long term has been absolutely no libido."
10623,"Yep, after 2 years I still do not have a real libido anymore."
10624,It has not returned and I have been actively working so hard to get it back but nothing seems to help.
10625,I would love to hear some feedback from anyone out there on what worked for them to bring it back.
10626,Im considering starting one of those pink pills they push on everything lol.
10627,(Also have had my hormones checked and I am completely fine).
10628,I'm a year off today and mine is still nonexistent.
10629,I feel your pain!!
10630,"Everyone is different...in regards to the other commenter for example, I do plenty of self stim and it has had absolutely no affect on boosting mine, lol.I've heard a fair number of success stories from women who have tried MACA powder."
10631,One friend is on it now and she told me she was not prepared for the surge.
10632,Her bf is loving it.
10633,It took a couple months to work but she says it's also helped her have more energy and less brain fog.
10634,Her provider recommended it to her.
10635,I think it could be worth a try
10636,"Skip the supplements, those are going to be snake oil and a waste of money."
10637,There are some OTC drugs for libido but as far as I've read they have limited uses and are not super effective.
10638,It doesn't hurt to ask your doctor about it though.
10639,"IME libido issues is not usually a medical problem, it's usually a stress management, relationship, or body issues problem."
10640,American sex educator Emily Nagoski explains in Come As You Are (which you should read if you haven't) that women usually have a lot of other traffic in our brain that prevents us from slowing down and getting into our bodies.
10641,Do some self reflection about your life and make time for things that put you in the mood.
10642,For me a key thing is regular exercise.
10643,I used to have an ex pick me up after yoga because I'd always be ready to go.
10644,"Also, do you have solo sex?"
10645,"Even if you're not in the mood, I think doing it regularly really helps."
10646,"Nagoski explains in her book that sex drive is not really a ""drive"" but a motivational system in our brain, so if you're feeling good and having orgasms, your brain will compel you to get more of that."

10656,I just started Junel.
10657,"I'm already on an IUD, and I'm taking the pill for 3 months to see if it'll shrink several cysts that I have."
10658,I previously got an IUD because the pill was making me feel insane.
10659,I'm now a month into it and I'm not sure I can deal with it anymore.
10660,"My mind has been racing nonstop, and my anxiety is at an alltime high."
10661,"It's definitely been messing with my emotions, and I feel like I've been quick to anger."
10662,I guess I'm just wondering if people taking this medication have dealt with this and it's gone away after time.

10668,I unfortunately had this issue on Junel I quit at 5 months.
10669,I wonder if you could discuss with your provider trying a different pill for the remainder of the 3month course (or a new 3month course)?
10670,"I know how miserable that is, it's not worth your sanity and quality of life!"
10671,Good luck OP.
10672,just letting you know ive been feeling the same way.
10673,im almost done with my first pack and i notice my mind is constantly racing and i feel a constant state of unease and nervousness.
10674,"i have endometriosis and i simply dont want to come off of birth control as it is the only thing keeping my endo under control, but i will say being aware of the side effects atleast has made me feel more controlled by them."
10675,for me im trying to manage the symptoms and letting myself feel however i do in the moment.
10676,im working on emotional regulation as much as i can.
10677,you got this girl your not alone!
10678,3
10679,I take the mini pill (cerazette) at the moment but I absolutely hate it.
10680,"Ive been on it almost two years and it makes me miserable, gain weight, acne the whole works."
10681,Im so miserable all the time I dont even want to have sex anymore i feel like its not worth taking it anymore but dont want to just use condoms.
10682,I have horrible anxiety and I really prefer to use 2 forms of contraception.
10683,I used to take Femodette and loved it but I ended up having to switch because of a migraine.
10684,I really really wish I could switch back because it feels like all my options from here are all the same hormones as the mini pill that it wont make any difference to my side effects.
10685,I feel trapped and its causing me a lot of distress.. does anyone have any suggestions for migraine friendly methods they did well on?
10686,or non hormonal?
10687,And do you think I have any chance of switching back to the combined pill or is the risk too high (
10688,"There are other types of progestin, they're not all the same and can have differing side effects for sure."
10689,I would try a different progestin only method until you hopefully find one that works better for you.
10690,"You're on desogestrel but there are norethindrone minipills, drospirenone minipills, depo shot is medroxyprogesterone acetate, hormonal IUDs are levenorgestrel, and the arm implant uses etonogestrel (very similar to desogestrel but the different dose and route changes things)."
10691,"There are of course the nonhormonal IUDs as well!I can't have estrogen either and I hated norethindrone, mostly liked the arm implant but it wasn't perfect, and now I am on Slynd minipill for about 9 months and it's my favorite so far."
10692,"In my experience, any form of hormonal birth control makes me depressed, anxious, gain weight and have acne."
10693,"You kinda cant win / if you want to use 2 methods, I use condoms and make him pull out on top of that and we havent had any scares at all, so Id definitely recommend that."
10694,Thats unfortunately the only way you can really guarantee to not have any negative side effects.

10699,I just feel reluctant to try others because I hear other people have such awful experiences on them too I hear so many good things about Slynd and it makes me really wish it was available in the UK ( I am about to spend a year studying abroad (so will only see bf once every few months) so I was considering coming off of it for the year and then trying something new once I come back
10700,Thanks for the advice!
10701,I think thats the way Im going to go for my year break and see how it works for me..
10702,I hope that maybe one of the types of mini pill I havent tried yet might be an improvement but Im not hugely optimistic so this might be the way forward for now
10703,"That sounds like a reasonable plan as long as you can stay safe through alternate means during your visits at least, gives you a break before trying something new and the hassle that comes with that."
10704,"I know how much the trial and error sucks, I've tried soooo many methods in my life and most did not work well."
10705,It's exhausting!
10706,That sucks Slynd isn't available there yet.
10707,I was always bummed desogestrel isn't available here in the US too since norethindrone didn't work out for me so I get it.
10708,"But there's definitely awful experiences for every method, I had a bonafide horror story on the ring (the reason I can't have estrogen) but it works great for some people."
10709,"It actually worked great for me too, until it didn't."
10710,I hope you at least feel better!
10711,Glad I could offer some insight!
10712,Please help me i started the pill 5 days ago on Sunday and since i have been so anxious and depressed.
10713,i honestly dont know if its the birth control or myself and i just really need to get help and i dont know if its the pill???
10714,can you get symptoms this early on and thats whats making me feel this way??
10715,?
10716,Hormonal changes can definitely start that soon.

10723,This is a pretty unique question but has anyone on the combo pill every experienced unusual spotting several weeks AFTER a surgery?
10724,I have severe pregnancy anxiety so I was sterilized on 7/31.
10725,"Ive had two placebo week periods since (first one was shorter than normal, which was to be expected after surgery and second one was light), but now halfway through my pack Im spotting."
10726,I dont usually experience spotting and have been on this pill on and off for 12 years.
10727,Could this spotting be from the surgery 6 weeks later?
10728,My incisions are almost healed.
10729,"The spotting was brown, then red, now pink."
10730,It also gets worse when I work out or have a bowel movement.
10731,I asked my gyn and she wasnt concerned at all nor did she offer any explanation other than stress.
10732,"I took urine and blood pregnancy tests, which were negative."
10733,"If I were pregnant, it would be from over 2 months ago and I would have to be one of those horror stories of people who had negative urine and blood tests."
10734,I also had an abdominal ultrasound a few weeks ago because of some pelvic pressure.
10735,Im just feeling pretty anxious still because I dont usually have spotting and would welcome anyones experiences with spotting on birth control several weeks after surgery or general anesthesia.

10743,I don't know if this is a bad thing or if it is a normal side effect of the pill.

10750,Abnormal bleeding a normal side effect.
10751,As long as you arent filling up pads in a hour or two consistently theres no need for you to be worried

10753,How much blood is there do you think?
10754,Did it eventually go away?
10755,i dont think im filling up pads thankfully but its still quite heavy  thanks for this!

10757,"Hi girlies,I started bc last month."
10758,Im sexually active.
10759,My period hasnt started and Im on the last day of my sugar pills.
10760,Should i wait for my period to come again before starting a new pack or just start the new pack after i finish my last pill?
10761,"Always start the new pack on time, ignoring what your bleeding is doing (especially if you're using the pill for contraception)."
10762,It's normal for your first month on the pill to be a bit of a wildcard.
10763,Things should even out after another pack or two.

10774,"After 1,5y of being off birth control ,which was great but I started to get extremely painful periods."
10775,So I talked with my GP and we decided to start with the patch as birth control methode because I'm very forgetful with the pill and the shot made me have way to many side effects.
10776,So I put the patch on like a day ago and I'm currently 1 week after my period cycle wise.
10777,I'm wondering when I can expect to notice spotting or other side effects.
10778,I know that it's different with everyone but if you got any experience with it please let me know )
10779,Id say after 3 weeks you can get mild symptoms of side effects.
10780,I personally had a bit of fatigue and headaches but after a while it worked well and now no effects.

10798,I noticed I started doing this wayyyyy more than normal  and the only thing different I can attribute to it is my birth control pills.
10799,I wouldnt consider it as impossible as its all hormonal.
10800,Its quite embarrassing when I think about it.

10855,I read some posts on here about gaining weight with this IUD and talking about getting it removed.
10856,Has anyone gotten it removed and did you lose the weight after?
10857,My self esteem has taken a serious hit because of this and I just want to know that Im not crazy and that its possible.
10858,I have an appointment with my doctor to discuss it and other options but I wanted some advice from anyone who has experienced it already first.Is anyone else having/has anyone had this same experience?

10865,Hi!
10866,So Ive been taking birth control since I was the age of 13 (Im in my late twenties).
10867,And I got the implant removed from my arm and tried doing pills but it really wasnt sticking.
10868,I decided in May that I wanted to go back on the implant but I need to find a new doctor because the one Im currently seeing is not very professional nor has my best interest at heart.
10869,"Ive been off of birth control almost a year and Ive noticed a few changes my body is recovery, it feels like it needs more rest, and over all, its been up and down but now its starting to feel better."
10870,I know hormones are playing a part and I can tell something else is wrong (I dont know what it is) with my body.
10871,Should I go back on birth control?
10872,Or find out whats going on with my body first before making a decision?
10873,Note I was sexually active when I had the implant but now I am not currently seeing anyone since Ive gotten off birth control due to reasons above and exhausted from dating.
10874,"TLDR been on birth control for over a decade, my body is out of whack."
10875,Would getting the implant be a good idea or finding out whats wrong with my body first?
10876,I think it's best to find out what's going on with your body first.
10877,You can get hormone and vitamin/mineral testing done to see where all of your levels are at.
10878,Your body has been healing from the synthetic hormones and is trying to figure out how to operate normally and naturally.
10879,Fatigue is common during this process.

10894,hello is it normal to have different reactions to nexplanon after getting it again?
10895,my girlfriend had nexplanon which made her bleed very frequently.
10896,she got it replaced with the iud due to this issue and then got pregnant a couple months later while on it.
10897,"when getting the abortion, she got the nexplanon again."
10898,we had sex once three days later and used plan b after out of fear of not waiting long enough.
10899,a week later we began having sex frequently and use a combination of the pull out method and nexplanon.
10900,"my worry is, is that enough?"
10901,after the iud failing my fear is significantly higher.
10902,she doesnt have any noticeable implant issues like pain but now instead of bleeding frequently she has hardly bled at all in the past month since getting it.

10955,"I have been to the ER two times now because the pain has gotten so bad I can barely function and Ibuprofen, muscle relaxants, or a heating pad were not helping at all."
10956,"Both times the conclusion was a muscle strain because they couldnt find anything with their tests (CT scan, bloodwork, urine test, etc)."
10957,They dont think its my IUD because they would expect the pain to be at the front.
10958,"Even though this pain is basically so low (right around my but crack) and it does not feel like muscle pain.Anyway, Im so desperate that I decided to go to Planned Parenthood today to remove my iud."
10959,My gyno has no availability until October and I cant wait that long.I guess Im posting because Id like so reassurance that Im not overreacting.
10960,Any similar stories that would offer some encouragement would be greatly appreciated
10961,This happened to me with my copper iud too!
10962,Was getting painful and originally they said nothing was wrong with it.

11026,I just feel like my birth control isnt working for me anymore even thought Ive been on it for a few years.
11027,When I first started taking it it was great and I felt pretty normal.
11028,Then I talked to my doctor about skipping my periods and started taking it continuously.
11029,I loved doing this I felt very stable and didnt have to worry about my period coming.
11030,But after a few months I started spotting and it wouldnt go away.
11031,So I decide to take it normally again and I feel like it hasnt been the same since.
11032,"I have been having really bad stomach issues and nausea, I feel like I am on a boat and cant eat anything."
11033,Also I have headaches and feel generally drowsy and fatigued.
11034,Has anyone else experienced this kind of sudden change?
11035,Im thinking about getting off the pill but I dont feel comfortable without a back up method.

11040,"I would recommend changing to a non pill method(patch, shot, ring, or IUD)."
11041,Sometimes pills just dont work or stop working for people as their bodies change over time.
11042,Just started taking birth control for the first time (now 3 weeks in) and about 2 weeks in I started to feel VERY emotional.
11043,"Like, emotional outbursts thinking I need to get mental help."
11044,"I've been getting easily annoyed, angry and depressed lately and am unsure why.Note that some of this is occurring the week before me period, but I started feeling off outside of that time period."
11045,"I know this can also be a factor, but am just wondering if other people have felt changes like this too?I'm currently on Aubra EQ and am going to try and give it a good 2 months on being on it before decided on switching or stopping birth control."
11046,I don't want to just quit becaue I know there are other factors that could be tied into how I've been feeling lately but I'm just curious about others' experiences

11052,Much more this month then ever.
11053,"I think that is the common side effect, but I'll finish this months pack then decide should I continue."
11054,I started my pills last November 2022.
11055,I'm on my fourth month of continuous use.
11056,"I've been spotting for 3 weeks now, a mix of red and brown discharge."
11057,Is it possible to stop this?
11058,Or the only way is to take the pill break so it will stop?

11063,Take a pill break/your placebo week and see if it stops.
11064,Unfortunately some peoples bodies just dont let them do continuous use without breakthroughs.
11065,Mine never did.
11066,I'm 24.
11067,I started BC with a desogestrel minipill 4 years ago.
11068,"This made me have nonstop period/spotting and was also making me depressed to the point of suicidal ideation, so after 4 months I moved to a combo pill (Levonorgestrel 0.1 mg/Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg, aka Loette or Aviane)."
11069,"I felt much better emotionally after 2 weeks, my PMS mood swings stopped, my periods were lighter and less painful, and overall I had no complaints besides some weight gain.I stopped after over a year as I wasn't planning on being sexually active for a while."
11070,"My PMS came back and my periods got more painful, but I also felt more energized and my libido was higher than before."
11071,"Felt good overall.I've started taking BC again 2 months ago, and since I had a great experience with Loette I asked my doctor to prescribe it again."
11072,But now I'm experiencing symptoms that I didn't experience last time.
11073,My breasts have grown to the point that just after 2 months I'm getting stretch marks.
11074,"I'm starting to feel down again, without any external factors causing it I randomly get this overwhelming feeling of emptiness, I cry easily over nothing, and feel more apathetic/uninterested in general."
11075,"My libido is also noticeably lower it was very high before, but now, even if I still feel tremendously attracted to my partner, I just don't have much desire and sex feels like a hassle a lot of the time."
11076,"I also feel like my cervix is lower/harder, as I used to have no pain during sex, and now certain positions where my partner goes deeper, like doggy, are too painful."
11077,I also feel more tired and have more frequent headaches.Looking for advice on what I should do.
11078,"I don't want to live like this, but since it has only been 2 months, should I push through and wait until my body gets used to it?"
11079,Is it normal for my body to react differently to the same pill?
11080,"The pill I'm taking now is the same dosage but a different brand from what I was taking before, could that have an impact?Thanks in advance )"

11093,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
11094,It is quite normal if its your first time and first month of using your pills.
11095,Usually body adjust to hormones in 3/6 months.
11096,"If you pass that and see that your acne is still there or getting worse, it could be a side effect from bc, then you can see if you just need to wait a bit more, as our bodies are all very different or you might want new bc method but I think you are just fine and in 3 months you will be all good."
11097,I did notice a flare up in my own acne when I started bc.
11098,"I had really bad one but after 2 months, it got better and now 10 months in, completely healed"
11099,thank you so much
11100,"Hi allProbably a lot of TMI here but it's a birth control group so bound to happen.Quick background, after having covid in 2021 I started having panic attacks."
11101,"Fast forward to today, in general I had those under control and was managing my anxiety and getting my life back.After reading about a Ted talk containing bullet points from a book (How the pill controls everything), I decided the 15 years of having absolutely 0 cycle, no period whatsoever could maybe be contributing towards my lack of ability to control my emotions.I have been off for almost 5 weeks and have no period yet (which is normal) but I have a lot of very intrusive thoughts, dizziness, really bad headaches, cramps, random episodes of type 7 stool, more cramps and bad joint pain/weakness in my legs."
11102,It feels like a period is coming but hasn't yet.
11103,Annoyingly all of these can be attributed to both anxiety and coming off birth control so hoping it will calm down once my cycles resume!
11104,Has anyone else suffered really bad after coming off and having no periods for years?
11105,?
11106,Sorry to hear you're struggling with these symptoms.
11107,It could very well be the withdrawal process.
11108,I had the nasty headaches.
11109,I also became depressed over a span of 3 wks after never being depressed a day in my life.
11110,Neither before or on the pill.
11111,It was scary.

11118,"This is totally normal, I was on depo for 22 years, and about the 6th month from when I was supposed to get my last shot all that kind of came on I guess it can last for up to a year until your cycle regulates"
11119,Hi everyone!
11120,Bit of a random question but I'm taking the hana pill which is progestogen only mini pill and it says you have to take one everyday at the same time.
11121,I've been taking it now for about a year at 9am every day.
11122,I'm planning on travelling to two countries with a time difference of 2 hours and the other is 4 hours and I'm wondering what time I take my pill now?
11123,Do I continue taking it at UK time of 9am so the time in the other countries would be either 11am or 5am or do I take it at the travel countries time of 9am?
11124,Does that make any sense sorry English isn't my first language.
11125,I don't know if I'm over thinking it.
11126,Also I've not had my period since November has anyone else had that too?
11127,Thanks for any help!
11128,Hana has a 12hour window before a pill is considered missed.
11129,"So, as long as you don't let more than 36 hours pass between two pills (the usual 24 hour interval  the 12 hour window) you will be fine."
11130,You can do either 9 am local time or UK time..It's common to stop having periods on desogestrel (and progestinonly methods in general).
11131,"I didn't stop bleeding completely but I can go months without a ""period""."
11132,"This is fine, and since desogestrel stops ovulation any bleeding is just breakthrough bleeding, not a true period."

11137,Hii thanks for your reply.
11138,That's good to know I was worried since whenever I buy it the doctor is always like make sure at the same time
11139,"It's better to take it close to the same time every day, because it lowers the risk of forgetting to take it."
11140,"It can also lower the chance of irregular bleeding.But the desogestrel minipill remains effective if it's taken within 12 hours of your usual time, just like combined pills."
11141,Other minipills are more timesensitive but they still have a 3hour window In your case if you choose 9 am because it's the most convenient/easiest to remember time it makes sense to take it at 9 am local time.
11142,Great thank you!
11143,"I was given cerazette mini pill for potential adenomyosis, to overall help with my periods."
11144,"Ive been taking it for five weeks now and still havent gotten my period, is this normal?"
11145,"Also, is the first period on the pill more painful?"
11146,what should i expect?
11147,"a lot of blood, less blood?"
11148,ive never taken birth control and im honestly kind of nervous snd confused.
11149,any experiences/advice will help!
11150,Thank you !
11151,Yes it's normal.
11152,"On progestinonly methods your periods can become irregular or stop, this can happen immediately or after a few months."
11153,My first period on desogestrel was lighter and less painful than my natural ones and it only improved from there.
11154,This is pretty typical.
11155,"It's very rare to bleed more heavily or have more pain on birth control, but some people have spotting or light bleeding that lasts for longer than their natural periods."
11156,"This can improve after 36 months, but if it bothers you some people take 2 desogestrel pills a day for a while."
11157,I havent had mine for the first two months either but then it came and it has been three weeks since it started i am trying to hang on and see if it settles.
11158,"if youre concerned about staining, i can at least tell you that it started with light spotting that i saw on my panty liner, so it wasnt like it was heavy right from the start, but thats just my experience"

11182,What is beyaz?
11183,I'm about to get off bc cause I'm (hopefully) getting a bisalp soon.
11184,I've been on various forms of bc for the past 6 years but mostly the pill.
11185,Right now I'm on nexplanon and I've been on it for about 2 or 3 months.
11186,Have any of yall gotten off bc?
11187,"If so, what was it like?"
11188,I'm a little nervous but I'm just so sick of the side effects and I'm not doing anything to warrant needing it anyway
11189,I have been off bc for 2y but I got of the bcshot.
11190,The first 3 months your body is still trying to regulate your hormones and shit so even though I got my period kinda regularly my moods didn't make sense at allll.
11191,"From 3mnths to 6mnths, my hormones settled down more and more."
11192,"So around 6mnths I could seperate the 4 fases of my cycle a bit (week after periodfeeling good, mood stable 2 weeks after periodfeeling amazing and pretty, mood stable week before periodgetting low self asteem, acne and getting into unstable and emotional mood period weeklow self esteem, very emotional  acne starts to clear up)But only after 1y I really felt like my hormones and stuff were completely figured out again by my body."
11193,There are some great parts and some meh parts about going off bc but I loved it and I'm only going back because my periods are incredibly painfull.
11194,Goodluck )
11195,I went off 2 years ago and my period is still not regular.
11196,No PCOS but its just strange how BC fucked up my cycle and it wont return to normal
11197,i was on nexplanon for a while.
11198,the removal was easy and didnt hurt.
11199,im currently getting off depo and the worst parts are the constant period (3 months!)
11200,and the hormonal acne

11227,wait u got constant periods on the depo shot or did i misunderstand?
11228,you misunderstood.
11229,i had no periods on depo and now im currently getting off depo and having a constant period.
11230,but its not a full period.
11231,not even enough to wear a pad or tampon.
11232,but enough to ruin my underwear if i sneeze
11233,ah i see yeah and yeah i had the same problem as well getting off the depo shot it was really annoying
11234,"Im very iffy about going on birth control however I had a unplanned pregnancy, unfortunately I miscarried."
11235,"Im 20, so it wasnt something that I was ready for."
11236,Hence me and my boyfriend decided to go with birth control and condoms.
11237,"Due to my dad having a heart attack at 30, I got the mini pill."
11238,Honestky Im terrified of blood clots and the weight gain as I do feel hungrier.
11239,I plan to take it on and off for a month at a time.
11240,BUT something really weird has been happening.
11241,I think my brain and body think Im pregnant.
11242,"Im 3 pills in and on pill 2, I had an insanely vivid dream about giving birth."
11243,I can still feel the pain.
11244,But I took it as just my brain adapting.
11245,But then last night I was laying tummy first and the thought of this isnt good for the baby comes to mind.
11246,I stand up and Im like Awww Im pregnant my baby.
11247,Then it took me a minute to realise there is no baby.
11248,Is this normal ?
11249,i think taking bc on and off a month at a time will mess with your hormones a lot more than just taking it as you are supposed to.
11250,"i've heard birth control can essentially make your body ""think"" it's pregnant, but i've never heard of someone actually thinking that, like, in their brain haha."
11251,"might just have been a really vivid dream, 3 days in is probably too early to tell if something is a side effect or not anyway )"
11252,You actually were pregnant so its very likely your dreams etc are due to that.
11253,"Perhaps you have some anxiety about it, or some sort of trauma etc  its completely normal for these things in our subconscious or conscious mind to appear during dreams."
11254,So I would say that these feelings are probably more psychological ones relating to your previous experience of being pregnant.
11255,"The pill can make your body think you are pregnant in the sense that side effects can mimic it, but I think the psychological effects are more likely due to the previous pregnancy."
11256,"Taking the pill on and off is not a good idea for 2 reasons first, your body takes around 3 months to adjust to the hormones when you start taking the pill, and sometimes longer to adjust when you stop."
11257,Continuously going on and off is likely to result in hormonal chaos and unpleasant side effects.
11258,"The weight gain etc will be worse during the first three months, so stopping / starting is not going to reduce that."
11259,"Secondly, I'm not actually sure that this would reduce any of the risks and I don't think any doctor would advise this to reduce the risks."
11260,"The risk of blot clots, in particular, is highest during the first year of taking birth control."
11261,So constantly stopping and starting might mean you never technically get past that first year phase.
11262,"The mini pill is already pretty low risk  in fact, all hormonal birth control is very low risk, it is just a slightly higher risk than without it, but that doesn't mean it is high risk."
11263,"If you are really concerned, perhaps look into a non hormonal method such as the copper IUD, or speak to your GP."
11264,"This sounds like a trauma response, not a sode effect."
11265,Its okay to be traumatized by a miscarriage and need to talk to someone.
11266,"Youve gotten some good advice here about the pregnancy side of things, so on another note, I would highly, highly recommend not taking birth control on and off for a month at a time."
11267,Highly.
11268,I think that would mess with your body/brain far more than being consistent.
11269,(I say this as someone who was on and off for a while due to other medical issues and insurance.
11270,it was awful.
11271,Either take it or dont.)

11276,I dont think this is a side effect of the birth control.
11277,Youve probably heard the your birth control makes your body think youre pregnant claim.
11278,"Its not true, hormonal birth control doesnt look like pregnancy at all, but its used as a euphemism to explain why hormones can stop ovulation."
11279,(In my opinion they should stop with the euphemisms altogether  its not that complicated)What I actually think may be happening is a reaction to the miscarriage.
11280,It is pretty common to have phantom pregnancy symptoms or thoughts after a miscarriage.
11281,Thats a big impact on your body and brain.
11282,"Hey yall, seen a lot of negative IUD experiences and I want to share (and open the floor to share) positive experiences.Im on my 3rd IUD."
11283,I love it and will continue using this method of birth control.
11284,"1Skyla 3yearsone big cramp on insertion, painless otherwise, cervix softener and ibuprofen taken priorlots of cramping and constant brown spotting first six months."
11285,Had regular periods for the first year.
11286,After that they slowly became irregular/non exsistent.
11287,"First 6 months of cramping was difficult but after that I never cramped again.removal after 3 years was a little uncomfortable but was told to cough as she removed it and it slide right out, just a little cramping2Kyleena5 yearsone big cramp on insertion, painless otherwise, cervix softener and ibuprofen taken priorabsolutely no side effects."
11288,I forget its there.
11289,"Every month Ill have a day of light brown spotting, barely noticeable."
11290,I never buy tampons again lol.
11291,No cramping at all.
11292,removal after 5 years was a little painful.
11293,"Was not told to cough and taken nothing prior for pain (different gyno) 3Kyleena current nothing taken beforehand (different GYNO) lots of cramping, most painful of the 3 but didnt last long."
11294,Few cramps and it was done.
11295,no side effects forget it is there.
11296,One day of light brown spotting a month.
11297,No cramping ever.
11298,Still havent had a full period and havent bought tampons in 10 years.Also  I have been sexually active the entire time with this as the main method of birth control.
11299,I do not use a secondary method.Overall I highly recommend this method.
11300,My experience has been positive.
11301,I love it!
11302,I love not having to keep up with anything and I love not having a period.
11303,Only downside is the cramping from insertion and the spotting and cramping while my body got used to it.
11304,Overall I would say those outweigh 10 years of protection and no period.
11305,Thank you for posting about the Skyla!
11306,"Thats probably my next option, as I found Im not allowed estrogen due to migraines."

11310,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
11311,Thanks for sharing!
11312,I've also had a positive experience.
11313,"1) Mirena  cervix softener, Ibuprofen, minimal pain during insertion."
11314,The lady that inserted it said I squirmed less than some women with children.
11315,I don't remember much cramping.
11316,First year or so heavy periods with lots of cramping.
11317,After a while my periods were short and light and a little irregular but never stopped completely.
11318,"Removal after 5 years, just slight cough and it slid right out and cramping, nothing major."
11319,I was single at the time and being evaluated for PCOS so I wanted to see how my periods were while I wasn't on anything.
11320,They were normal.
11321,2) Kyleena  I had cervix softener but took it a little later than recommended and Ibuprofen.
11322,The insertion was more painful but not excruciating and afterwards it felt like my uterus was trying to give me a spontaneous hysterectomy.
11323,"Despite a more painful insertion, I like my Kyleena better than Mirena."
11324,Mostly my periods have been at most light and 2 days.
11325,But now it has completely stopped my periods.
11326,I haven't bought feminine hygiene products in years and probably won't have to buy them again.
11327,It will expire in early 2025.
11328,I plan on immediately getting it replaced with another IUD probably another Kyleena.
11329,And being in my late 30s in a family that goes through early menopause I hope it will be my last one.
11330,"Not that I haven't loved my IUD, but it will be nice to not worry at all."
11331,I was sexually active off and on while I had Mirena.
11332,And the majority of the time why I've had the Kyleena.
11333,My fiance and I do not use any other protection at this time but he is planning on getting a vasectomy soonish to ensure we don't have any surprises.I love not having to think about it for years!
11334,Not having a period can cause anxiety but I keep tests around to calm my anxiety.
11335,And because of these tests I know my IUD is doing what it's supposed to do.
11336,I forget it is there.
11337,Can I ask what crevice softener you used?
11338,Was it over the counter ?
11339,I just got the Kyleena today have you or anyone here noticed weight gain?
11340,i haven't had my IUD (Liletta) for too long but am having no problems so far!!
11341,highly recommend!
11342,What crevice softener did you use ?
11343,It was given by the obgyn
11344,Yes!
11345,"I dont know if related to Kyleena or coincidence, but I gained 10 pounds three months after getting my Kyleena."
11346,At six months Id gained a total of 17 pounds.
11347,"However Im also hypothyroid, have PCOS and depression so those couldve been a factor."
11348,It was prescribed I don't remember what it was called.
11349,Thank you for the comment!
11350,Did you have those things before Kyleena?
11351,Yep!
11352,Id been diagnosed with all those things at least 2 years before getting a Kyleena IUD.
11353,Ive had the Kyleena IUD for more than four years now.
11354,"I always assumed my acne was just normal teenage acne, but Im 20 years old now and my acne hasnt gone away, even though Ive been on top of my skincare routine."
11355,I wake up every day with at least one zit.Im starting to suspect the IUD is the culprit.
11356,Do you think switching to birth control pills will decrease my acne?
11357,"Ive heard upon switching, the breakouts will be worse, but the acne totally goes away after a few months."

11362,I had my last shot of Depo Provera in January of this year (2023) so about 8 months ago.
11363,For the last 23 months I have been pretty much nonstop bleeding.
11364,"Itll be somewhat obvious when its meant to be my actual period (e.g red blood) but then until the next one its brown and slightly lighter, but constant."
11365,I never bled whilst on Depo which was for just less than 2 years.

11370,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
11371,"Yup, constant bleeding."
11372,So much so that I became severely anemic and I had to get transfusions.
11373,I would contact your doctor and let them know!
11374,They'll probably give you a blood test to see if everything is alright.
11375,I had spotting during depo to the point of using pantyliner on the daily.
11376,It was inconvenient.
11377,"Funny enough, I didn't experience it when I was under the 1mo injection."
11378,"Hi Redditors!This is a post both about my current experience and to see if anyone else has had similar, or other side effects."
11379,A bit about my circumstances I have adenomyosis and vaginismus so basically my entire pelvic area is just a barrel of fun.
11380,"My Gyno recommended the mirena to manage my adeno symptoms, and not having a period is always a potential fun side effect."
11381,"I havent been on BC for almost 7 years, so I imagine my body is a bit freaked out."
11382,"I have had the mirena before, about 16 years ago and didnt have any side effects."
11383,This time is a whole new experience.
11384,The insertion was brutal.
11385,"Not only in the moment, but I had to stay laying down for a bit for fear of passing out."
11386,I went home and passed out the rest of the day.
11387,"Side effectsMild, not daily crampingDaily spotting that ranges from light brown to actual bleeding but never heavier than a linerGas."
11388,Is this a side effect?
11389,"Ive never been regular in my life, but since insertion, I have pooped daily and been so gassy!Definitely bloatedAcne the first week, but has completely cleared up nowFatigue Mild depression some daysIncreased libido Low back discomfort has been constantBreast pain ranging from slight tenderness to holy shit they hurt."
11390,"Hubby says theyre significantly larger too Today, day 18, Ive had diarrhea and intense cramping with a bit heavier spottingvaginal discomfort (could also be due to increased libido)Is this normal?"
11391,What were your symptoms?
11392,Anyone have experience with the IUD and having adeno or vaginismus?
11393,Im interested too!
11394,I just got mine in yesterday.
11395,I had the same exact experience.
11396,"I almost passed out, very dizzy, the nurse had to give me an ice pack, and check my blood pressure Ect."
11397,Cramping so bad it felt almost like contractions.
11398,Im very nervous about the next few days/ weeks.
11399,I didnt bleed much after it was put in but I do see that I am spotting.
11400,Im not sure what to expect.
11401,I just dont want to gain a lot of weight like I did with my implant in my arm.

11407,I felt worlds better on day 2!
11408,"My initial experience 16 years ago I had no spotting, no period, and no weight gain."
11409,"I just weighed myself and I havent gained anything yet, despite the fact that I am bloated and its noticeable to me in my abdominal area."
11410,"I did get it inserted 23 days before my period started, so that could maybe be the difference in why I havent stopped bleeding/spotting?"
11411,Possibly.
11412,That would make sense.
11413,Plus your body is trying to get used to the changes that are happening.
11414,I read some things and it said that weight gain is very little If any.
11415,That was why I wanted either the IUD or the pill.
11416,The implant made me blow up like a balloon.
11417,I would just watch on how much blood is coming out.
11418,If its a concerning amount.
11419,"Or an unusual amount, I would call your doctor or womans clinic."

11431,I guess I can just ask the dr tomorrow.
11432,But I am really dreading it and want to know if this would be safe to do.
11433,Lol i did this and i cannot say for sure it helped me at all.

11442,Was feverish and nauseous and basically couldnt move out of the fetal position for hours.

11456,Ive been on bc for 5 years and felt like it really impacted my libido.
11457,"I stopped taking mine a few weeks ago and so far have been dealing with some minor skin issues, cravings and an array of emotions (my ability to cry feels heightened)."
11458,"If I were on bc, this would be the week I would get my period."
11459,"I felt all of the symptoms of a prebc period, painful cramps/breasts, anger/irritability, etc."
11460,but I still havent gotten my period.
11461,Is it normal for there to not be any menstrual bleeding but feel all the other symptoms of a period?
11462,I just got off after 19 years.
11463,I have PCOS and my dr advised me it may take a few months to regulate.
11464,I got all the symptoms around the time I was supposed to get it on the pill.
11465,Ended up getting my period 2 weeks after the symptoms.
11466,Pretty much 1.5 months off the pill.
11467,Yeah it's normal to feel a bit weird for a while
11468,This happened to me.
11469,For the week of my period I got all the symptoms but no period.
11470,I ended up getting it the following week but all the symptoms again for that week.
11471,Ive heard it takes 6 months to regulate
11472,Exact same thing happened to me as well!
11473,it is totally normal to feel a little off first few months i noticed i started feeling better after the first month.
11474,My period was late but what helped it return was Myo Inositol.
11475,Just be careful as it can increase fertility.

11510,"I have no idea, that's between you and your uterus."
11511,It's really hard to predict bleeding and everyone's body is different.
11512,Thanks! )
11513,Hi!
11514,Please correct me if Im wrong.
11515,"But being on this sub for a while, I notice all the IUD horror stories (which is one of the reasons why I chose to get an implant for myself)Personally, the implant for me is definitely one of the best decisions Ive done for myself."
11516,So I would love to know (and please feed my curiosity) why more women prefer IUDs over implants?
11517,Thanks!EDIT Thank you so much for ALL the responses!
11518,"I didnt expect this to blow up  That being said, since my implant seems to work for me, I think after 3 years Im going to switch to an IUD."
11519,"But since it is not as effective as an implant in terms of preventing pregnancy, my fiance (husband by then) is willing to get a vasectomy too."
11520,Thank you so much again!
11521,IUD typically lasts longer.
11522,Implant is notorious for irregular bleeding and I cant deal with that.
11523,all the IUD horror storiesYou notice the horror stories because the people (like me!)
11524,"who have a positive but unremarkable IUD experience aren't talking about it...and one reason I don't talk much about it is because every time I do, someone pops out of a trash can to tell me horror stories of some friendofafriend whose IUD was responsible for some improbably horrific things."
11525,"Multiple people have earnestly told me the same verbatim totally real true story of someone (always at least two degrees of separation from the person telling me) who ""had a baby that came out holding their IUD""  WTF"
11526,I chose my copper IUD because its both nonhormonal and super effectiveI cant get that same level of effectiveness without hormones any other way (short of sterilization which I dont want.)
11527,It also lasts a decade which is awesome!
11528,Plenty of women want and/or need a reliable nonhormonal (or centralized lowhormonal) option which various IUDs provide.
11529,"Copper IUDs have no hormones, and hormonal IUDs have much lower amounts of hormones than some other options (and its centralized to your uterus so there are often fewer hormonal side effects that way.)"
11530,"And while there are plenty of IUD horror stories, there are plenty of horror stories about every kind of birth control, partly because people who have bad experiences are wayyy more likely to speak up about it than people where it goes smoothly."
11531,"I dont think there are necessarily more horror stories about the IUD than about any other methods, tbh."
11532,Ive personally heard bad things about the implant which is why I avoided it!
11533,"Personally the copper IUD was by far the best option for me and absolutely the best decision Ive made for my body, Im very grateful to avoid all the hormonal side effects while still feeling safe."
11534,Definitely Paragards biggest fan.
11535,"I have had almost zero side effects from the IUD and the procedure was a breeze, whereas I had bad side effects from all the hormonal options Ive tried."
11536,I have tried different forms of BC.
11537,"2 different pills, Nexplanon and now Skyla IUD."
11538,"Out of all of these, the IUD has been the absolute best for me."
11539,I have nothing negative say about it.
11540,"With Nexplanon, I was bleeding constantly."
11541,"I lost so much blood, no appetite, horrible headaches from constant bleeding."
11542,"I needed the opportunity to reduce my bleeding, and I heard mirena was a good option for that."
11543,I love mine overall.
11544,Plus seeing my friends' arm bars gives me the shivers.
11545,"I also had friends who didn't have a great experience with their arm implants, so there was some bias."
11546,Depo shot made me gain 60 pounds in 6 months and I heard Nexplanon was similar to the shot.
11547,Mirena was my last shot to help with my heavy heavy periods.
11548,Mirena is the only fda approved birth control to help with heavy menstrual bleeding.
11549,"Most women lose 15ml to 30ml blood loss for one period, based on tampon use I lose over 500ml per one period which is 7 days equivalent of a bottle of DayQuil."
11550,80ml and over is considered heavy bleeding.
11551,Ive heard more horror stories with the implant than with the IUD
11552,"IUDs last longer, there's a non hormonal option for IUDs and honestly, implants aren't available everywhere."
11553,Canada only approved the implant in 2020 so it was never really an option here.
11554,On top of that they're so recent not a lot of insurance companies will cover them if they cover birth control.
11555,"Also, some conditions some women have are localized to the uterus so hormonal IUDs are recommended for symptom relief."
11556,"I had the implant twice, for a number of years."
11557,"It worked great at first, but then I didnt stop bleeding for months."
11558,It sucked.
11559,"I got it removed, went off all BC for a bit and then began considering options again."
11560,"I ultimately decided on the IUD, as it seemed the best option for me (no user error, very effective, lasts a while) but I was TERRIFIED of the pain."
11561,I also read the horror stories on here and heard some first hand from friends.
11562,"I decided to get one, but only if I could get put under for the insertion."
11563,I talked with my doctor and she actually took my concerns seriously.
11564,She told me about their clinic standards for pain management and I decided to just go ahead with that.
11565,I was so nervous but it actually went super well!
11566,"They gave me antianxiety meds 30 minutes beforehand (they made me very loopy lol), did a cervical numbing shot (which I honestly didnt feel at all."
11567,"Apparently when people say the cervix doesnt have nerves theyre referring to this, where the cervix cant feel needle/poky pain."
11568,It can feel other types of pain tho.
11569,"), I had my bf in the room, they gave me heating pads for over and under my tummy, warmed up the lubricant and instruments, gave me a lollipop, told me I could put in headphones, dimmed the lights so they werent so harsh, and told me what they were doing and what to expect at every step."
11570,They told me I could stop them at any time.
11571,And it went great!!
11572,It should honestly be the standard.
11573,"It was more discomfort than pain and was very manageable, like Ive had Pap smears more painful."
11574,"I will say the cramps afterward were pretty bad, I had to stay home from work."
11575,I got it a few months ago and still get the occasional cramp.
11576,Its still adjusting even now but its better than before.
11577,I will also say (maybe TMI) I have noticed a bit of a change in vaginal odor.
11578,"Not necessarily in a bad way, although it did get bad at times, but different."
11579,Didnt know that was a thing!
11580,Overall Im happy with it.
11581,"Id say if youd ever consider getting the IUD, to find a doctor that takes pain management seriously, and someone who is experienced."
11582,"My doctor said she basically does this all day every day, and I could tell."
11583,Im happy you found the implant works for you!
11584,!
11585,"My doctor said in her experience about 30 of women stop having periods, 30 get worse periods, and the rest continue with regular periods with the implant."
11586,"I have it, and dont have periods."
11587,"Ive had several, actually, and Im lucky thats what I get."
11588,Personally my old doctors office no longer offered them.
11589,She had seen to many people have horrible side effects and constant bleeding so made the choice to no longer offer them.
11590,There are pluses and minuses to all forms of birth control.
11591,"Also, youre mostly going to see horror stories on Reddit."
11592,Thats not an accurate representation of the general population.
11593,"IUD lasts longer, better bang for my buck and to remove it I dont need to be cut open and then taped/stitched back up."
11594,"Its just shoving my cervix to the side and pulling for normal removal.Edited stitched, apparently stitches are not needed."
11595,"For me, my mom is an ob/gyn nurse and she has more horror stories with depo shot and nexplanon and very few with the pill and IUD."
11596,When it came time for me to decide ultimately me and my provider discussed and I decided on a Kyleena IUD but I definitely took her advice to heart.
11597,Loved my IUD (mirena).
11598,Insertion sucked but it was smooth sailing for the next five years.
11599,I honestly only chose an iud because medicaid wouldn't cover the implant for some reason.
11600,Plus I got lucky and got my iud under anesthesia.
11601,"I switched to the pill after my implant, so I do not have any experience with IUDs."
11602,"However, I would choose an IUD over an implant any day."
11603,Nexplanon was the WORST decision I ever made.
11604,I had it for 6 years and I feel like those years were stolen from me.
11605,I didnt realize until I removed it how sick it was making me.
11606,"Not everyone has a bad experience with the implant, but I believe the majority struggle with it."
11607,"I had the implant for four months, I cried, screamed and was horribly angry every day."
11608,"Every single day I would have a emotional meltdown, on top of the irregular bleeding."
11609,"I would be bleeding clots one day, brown the next and sometimes not at all."
11610,But to this day I never say that someone considering it should avoid it.
11611,"Everyone is different and it is so important to understand that a option that is perfect for you, could not be for another person."
11612,"I have several friends that the Implant has been a day dream for them, for me it wasnt."
11613,Implanted me bleed for 9 months straight and I ended up rushed to hospital to have it removed because I was so anaemic.Copper IUD has been brilliant!
11614,No issues at all besides slightly heavier (but shorter) periods
11615,Went in to my doctor wanting an implant after my friend raved about theirs.
11616,My doctor informed me many of her patients ultimately chose to have the implant removed.
11617,"In the country I moved to many doctors were unfamiliar with the implant, so people would have to go to the dermatologist to have it cut out."
11618,"With that in mind, my doctor advised I go with the IUD."
11619,I loved my first one until she went on vacation up in my uterus and I had to be put under and get her removed  I'm on my second one now and enjoy the minimal side effects.
11620,My friend had their implant removed eventually after having a period for months on end.
11621,"Personally, the implant freaked me out way more."
11622,I knew people with the implant and being able to see it in my arm was something that really freaked me out.
11623,But I also knew I didn't want to keep taking a daily pill so IUD it was!
11624,I love mine.
11625,"Insertion wasn't fun, but the pain was temporary for great results."
11626,"Implant was not available until recently in a lot of places, when was looking for options other than the pill 4 years ago IUD or nuva ring were my only choices and given my forgetfulness I went with the one I wouldn't have to think about for 5 years, the IUD"
11627,"I was offered a Mirena IUD by my gyno because I'm over 30, diabetic, and smoke cigs."
11628,She wasn't comfortable prescribing pills any longer.
11629,"She also said it should help with PCOS symptoms, which it has greatly.I would have declined an implant."
11630,The word alone squicks me out and knowing it was dwelling inside me just below my skin and I'd feel it.
11631,Ew.My IUD insertion went great.
11632,It was inserted on my period.
11633,Only felt like a gut punch to my inner down there parts and subsided very quickly.
11634,It has regulated and lightened my flow immensely and has prevented pregnancy for 4 years and counting.
11635,Its very difficult to get the implant in Canada and most insurances dont cover it.
11636,IIRC it wasnt available at all up here until really recently
11637,"Not a woman but I have an iud, I was sorta pressured to get mine."
11638,I went in to get the shot because the pills were making me Hella wanna die.
11639,And vomiting.
11640,"And the doctor was like, ""You should get an IUD"" and when i asked about pain she said it would be just a strong pressure."
11641,Lemme tell you that was the worst pain of my life.
11642,I saw stars for the first time ever.
11643,And stumbled to a bathroom to projectile vomit.
11644,I was traumatized.I was also 19 and didn't know anything about birth control and was trusting that the doctor knew what was best.She told me to not be a baby when I mentioned I was anxious.
11645,But In what i took as a playful tone.
11646,Tho I was uncomfortable the whole time.
11647,Looking forward to getting it taken out/s
11648,My best friend had an iud press through her uterine lining during gymnastics.
11649,She almost bled to the internally!
11650,"So, I'm definitely not getting one of those bc that freaked me out so much."
11651,"She's okay, though!I'm 8 months into my 2nd implant, and I love it."
11652,"No periods at all , no cramps and only the occasional sore boob."
11653,"Bot to mention, probably tmi, but my fiancee finishes inside me all the time, and I haven't had a single scare."
11654,"Also, my hormones arent wacky anymore, and it helped my extremely heavy periods."
11655,"I know not everyone has had such a good experience, though!I feel like there are just as many pros and cons as the other.Edit also one plus the implant has over the iud is you never have to wonder if it's out of place."
11656,"There's no reaching up your coochie to feel for a string, you can just feel it in your arm and know your good."
11657,"Hormonal IUDs release a lower hormone dose than the implant, and they typically don't stop ovulation."
11658,For some people that means less side effects and a lower impact on their body.
11659,IUDs and the shot are not affected by enzymeinducing medication that makes other types of birth control (including the implant) less effective.
11660,"If you want something nonhormonal but also highly effective/set and forget and aren't ready for sterilisation, the copper IUD is pretty much the only method that ticks all those boxes."
11661,"But I don't think IUDs are objectively better than the implant or vice versa, it depends on the person and their priorities."
11662,"Some people might want or need a method that stops ovulation, or they could tolerate the implant's progestin better than the IUD's or prefer the higher effectiveness of the implant."
11663,"As a male dr who hasnt had to deal personally with either, but specializes in contraception, my two cents are youre mostly gonna hear the bad and dramatic stories on reddit."
11664,When a new patient asks for contraception i always talk about the pros and cons of all the different methods and why i would recommend one over the other for that specific person etc.
11665,but i always recommend against Implant (nexplanon).
11666,I just havent had good experiences with it with my patients.
11667,Id say more than half of people who had it in got it removed before it was up because of side effects.
11668,And i try to promote good contraception that you will be able to tolerate for its recommended time.
11669,Also the baby holding the iud thing is a complete lie.
11670,Just had to get it out of my system lol
11671,some (copper) IUDs are nonhormonal so thats a big one for people that dont want to or cant have regular BC
11672,"If the implant works for you, I dont see why you should switch to the IUD."
11673,I loved the convenience of the IUD but my body did not like it.
11674,"After a couple of years, it would move out of position (and this happened THREE TIMES and with every IUD I had), and I even got pregnant on the copper one (my guess is that the Mirena still worked slightly out of position because of the hormones)."
11675,The pill made me have a crying meltdown panic attack episode type thing where at 12am I cracked every single egg in a carton of six into a frying pan shells and all and thought about how pointless life was while I played with a large knife and you the picture.
11676,All birth control have horror stories.
11677,Couldn't pay me to get an IUD.
11678,No amount of money.
11679,"I personally hate hormonal birth control so much, but it's life saving for a lot of women."
11680,"Point is we're all different, hopefully eventually you can find something that works for you )"
11681,Ive had both.
11682,I prefer the iud because I had bad side effect with the implant.
11683,But my iud insertions are a breeze with zero pain so it doesnt bother me.
11684,I cant tolerate hormones too so the copper iud has been the only thing that has been working.
11685,Was only recently available in Canada when I got my iud.
11686,I love my IUD though and will probably get another one.
11687,Copper IUD has no hormones.
11688,I want to just let my cycle work itself out.
11689,"I don't deny that hormones aren't helpful for a lot of women, but I've never had a great reaction to any hormonal BC (Marvelon, Seasonique and Mirena)."
11690,No period
11691,I had an implant for a year.
11692,I began experiencing irregular bleeding at the 6 month mark and soon began bleeding every single day to the point my doctor gave me Provera to stop the bleeding and scheduled me to remove it.
11693,Have had a Mirena for 5.5 years without any irregular bleeding.
11694,My OB says the implant would hurt my mental health more than it already is.
11695,So I have an IUD.
11696,Everyone I knew with an implant gained a lot of weight and they didnt recommend it because of that.
11697,Im talking an alarming amount of weight.
11698,That was one reason and also the iud lasts longer so I went with that
11699,I have had both and unfortunately I didnt have a good experience with either.
11700,I got the nexplanon first when I was 20.
11701,After 4 months I got a heavy period that didnt go away.
11702,I bleed for 8 weeks straight.
11703,"Not spotting, but full on day 1 bleeding for 8 weeks."
11704,I fainted in a target and my pcp took it out the next day.
11705,After that I had the Mierna when I was 25.
11706,For a year I had no issues.
11707,Then I started having severe cramping.
11708,I wasnt bleeding (light spotting here and there) but the cramping was unbearable.
11709,I finally got an ultrasound and it perforated my uterus.
11710,I got it taken out and since then Ive been doing the nuva ring and feeling much better.
11711,I tried the implant and became incredibly depressed and suicidal so.theres that
11712,the iud was the worst thing i ever tried.
11713,the implant lasts 4 years and it was really good
11714,I absolutely love my implant.
11715,Ill definitely keep use it until I decide to have kids
11716,"My implant was no longer working for me, so the IUD was really a last resort."
11717,I actually tried the implant first because I liked that it was less invasive and had an easier insertion.
11718,"However, I had a lot of irregular bleeding with it and I was a lot more emotional which resulted in a lot of anger toward my partner."
11719,"So I tried the IUD and my bleeding has actually decreased a lot, my emotions are fine, and the insertion wasnt as bad as I thought itd be (there was a scheduling issue so I ended up showing to my appointment without having taken any painkillers beforehand)."
11720,I've tried almost everything.
11721,While having surgery I agreed to try the coil hormonal to see if it helped my heavy painful periods.
11722,It made my bleeding all over the place and was extremely painful.
11723,I have a bladder prolapse and a suprapubic catheter and the coil pressed against it.
11724,The moment it was removed I felt immediate relief.
11725,It was painful being removed but I'm so glad I no longer have it.
11726,I have gone back to the implant in my arm and it's so much more comfortable.
11727,You are numbed to have it implanted and removed and my periods happen less often.
11728,I will be sticking to the implant in my arm.
11729,I needed a non hormonal option due to the increased risk of breast cancer.
11730,Implant is also notorious for its horror stories!
11731,A lot of people prefer the copper IUD as it doesn't affect hormones.
11732,The implant was an absolute nightmare for me.
11733,"Broke my skin out, made me gain weight, and I got so moody."
11734,"It was also placed incorrectly, too close to a tendon / I had it removed about 56ish months ago, but the removal site still hurts sometimes."
11735,"I didnt want a scar and I wanted it to be easily removable if it didnt work out, basically"
11736,My understanding is that with IUDs the hormones are more localised to your uterus so might help with side effects.
11737,I know just as many people who had issues with their implants being put in as coils (not many for either) but I'm surprisingly squeamish and can't get over the fact I'd have some plastic in my arm I can't get out  I'm happy with my current method but I'd sooner chose a coil over an implant
11738,"I have the non hormonal IUD, the hormonal birth controls destroyed my body."
11739,Have a copper IUD and I love it.
11740,People are more likely to post about their negative experiences than their positive ones doesn't mean there aren't people out there who are happy about theirs.
11741,"Me personally, I do not like how the implant can be felt through the skin that would give me the creeps."
11742,The implant turned me into a monster.IUD is the only nonhormonal option
11743,"I chose the Kyleena IUD because the dosage of hormones was lower, but still had similar efficacy rates."
11744,Id rather go through that pain and have fewer side effects.
11745,I picked a hormonal IUD because it lasts longer and would lighten periods.
11746,"At 7.5 years post insertion, I could not be happier with my choice!"
11747,I personally have no issues with the device and it took my periods away completely!!!
11748,I'm going on 6 years without a traditional period.
11749,Light spotting that is inconsistent that I can't even use products.
11750,I literally do not own feminine products in my home that's how awesome this has been for me.
11751,"Plus, the device was only supposed to work for 5 years, it's now up to 8."
11752,So I got 3 extra years for free )
11753,I just didnt like the idea of being cut open.
11754,"IUD insertion seemed like an easier route, and there were more choices of IUD than there were for an implant."
11755,Insertion was a little uncomfortable but it was fast and I didnt have any pain after.
11756,My period went away completely.
11757,Im on my second hormonal IUD now and I dont think lll use another form of birth control if I dont have to.
11758,I still dont get a period and its been 5 years.
11759,I used to have really bad periods so it ended up being a winwin for me.
11760,Im not even considering switching to the implant at this point.
11761,I dont think its for me
11762,"i know people who had implant horror stories and i know people who love their iud, like with any birth control it entirely depends on the person."
11763,I was convinced by my primary to get an IUD when my implant was up to be replaced.
11764,Only had it for 8 months till i had my gyno take it out and get the implant again.
11765,I did not have any periods on the implant and no side effects but with the IUD i had constant bleeding and painful ovulation cysts every month.
11766,Im so happy to be back with the implant.
11767,I really wanted the implant to work because the thought of IUD scared me.
11768,"Implant was initially great for me, then I got the neverending period, gained weight, and started losing hair."
11769,Doctor said it must be a thyroid problem but my labs were all fine.
11770,Got the implant removed about 20 months in and it all resolved.
11771,Fortunately removal was really easy in my case.Now have Mirena  Insertion was both better and worse than I expected.
11772,"Period still comes unpredictably but its like a day at a time, not constant."
11773,"I do miss being able to see the implant and know its working  I never feel the Mirena and strings were cut high enough that I cant really check, so rely on my annual visit to confirm."
11774,But Im also in a no choice state so we usually use condoms as well anyway.
11775,I had the implant and switched to the iud because I bled for months at a time and it made me miserable.
11776,After some deliberation I got the iud and its the best decision I ever made.
11777,"Besides the pain of getting it in, my periods last 3 days and are regular for the first time ever."
11778,I also only use one liner per day of my period bc its so light.
11779,Also my boobies got bigger (not sure if thata in my head but Ive convinced myself thats the case)
11780,I cannot be on any form of hormonal BC (clotting disorder  yay!
11781,"), so my only contraceptive options are barrier methods or the Copper IUD."
11782,"Barrier methods arent nearly as effective as the Copper IUD, so I figure I cant do much better unless I decide to get sterilized."
11783,I'm on epilepsy medication and implants wouldn't be as effective for me.
11784,"Also, my IUD never gave me any problems."
11785,There are a lot of IUD horror stories because people with bad experiences tend to post more (understandably!
11786,).
11787,I chose iud over nexplanon BUT my gyno said shed put in the nexplanon instead.
11788,She didnt really give a reason or explain.Its been hell for almost a year n I finally got it taken out last week.
11789,Im scared of any bc at this point.
11790,I thought about an iud but Im letting my body adjust.
11791,I have nexplanon since start of august.
11792,"First week has arm pain and bleeding, otherwise I have only bled once about 1 month later."
11793,"No spotting so far, just a period.Edit  typo"
11794,The nexplanon implant gave me a fake brain tumor and my brain was shutting down
11795,I had an implant for a year and a half and at one point had my period for 2 months straight with only 3 days of a break that entire time.
11796,I couldnt do it anymore
11797,"Hmm, every womens body is different."
11798,"So you can't listen to the stories, you just have to experience it yourself."
11799,I've heard so many IUD horror stories but have also heard many success stories.
11800,"I have had the mirena three times now, the first time was for 3 years, second time was for 2 and I just got it again a couple months ago."
11801,I don't get my period and if I do it's minimal spotting every couple months.
11802,"The only negative for me would be it lowers my appetite, by a lot, so I loose a lot of weight."
11803,It also makes me very tired.
11804,Other than that I love it.
11805,I had an implant for 3 years and first year was wonderful.
11806,Over the course of the next two years side effects started one after the other.
11807,It started with the place of the implant being ridiculously itchy like 100 mosquito bites.
11808,Them I got my period for months without a single day without belading.
11809,I started getting depression symptoms.
11810,My left breast started hurting like hell with any touch to it.
11811,So all of that combined made me not want to try again eventhough I loved it.
11812,It was my first hormonal BC and I think I'm just rllu sensitive to it.
11813,I have a copper IUD now for two weeks but honestly I hate it so so so much I don't recommend it at all.
11814,"I don't feel like myself, I have cramps all the time to the point I can't move (never ever had cramps B4) and I'm scared or sex and as the cherry on top it HURTS when (tmi warning) I orgasm so yeah."
11815,Guess I'm just an unlucky case )
11816,Implant pros1.
11817,It doesnt fall out2.
11818,Its more effective than anything else on the marketImplant consEverything elseMirena pros1.
11819,"Effective if it stays in place, but less than the implantMirena consEverything elseI had the same awful side effects for both of them and I constantly bled heavily."
11820,Both took away my libido.
11821,"Out of the two, Id choose the implant."
11822,W the depo shot I had 1) weight gain 2) hair loss 3) increase in acne?
11823,4) more up and down emotions 5) nonstop period 6) headaches 7) also scary bc you can only get it for a certain amount of yrs before it could cause potential health issues  like infertility?
11824,(Someone correct me if Im wrong here) With the iud I have 1) no period2) lasts for years 3) dont have to get poked every month 4) no weight gain 5) no hair loss 6) no acne
11825,Opted for the IUD first time around bc of the irregular bleeding.
11826,Then had my own horror story (2!
11827,Failed!
11828,Insertions!)
11829,and opted for nexplanon.
11830,Love it so much and ain't going back.
11831,"Well for me it was the fact that when I researched about birth control methods other than the pill, a lot of sources said that the hormones from the IUD are in such a light dose that it won't affect me in the same way like the pill, or another hormonal birth control like the implant would."
11832,And that was a huge deal for me because I didn't really like the way the pill was making me feel back then.
11833,Unfortunately (and I have to point out that every body is different!)
11834,"it was really not a good decision for me to get the IUD because it almost had the same effects on me that the pill had, which were just not good in so many ways."
11835,"I actually wanted to get something non hormonal, but you also hear a lot of horror stories around the copper IUD so this sounded like the best solution in the moment.."
11836,I had the implant for 6 years and had 3 weeks of period in a month at the end.
11837,I also gained 70lbs and couldnt drop weight for the life of me AND I was ravenously hungry all the time.
11838,IUD put in and yes it was painful for like 2 days but now I have regular periods and I have lost 40lbs.
11839,Mirena is 99.8 effective honestly its higher than norethindrone mini pills at 99.5 with perfect use and I used those for 4 years without condoms and pull out so I dont think you have anything to worry about when it comes to IUD effectiveness.
11840,Ive had mirena for 5.5 years now.
11841,Its approved for 8 and clinical trial studies state its still 99.2 effective at the end of year 8 which is better than kyleena at 98.5 after 5 years and skyla which starts at 99.1
11842,"IUDs are generally a lot safer, nothing goes into your blood stream therefore not effecting your physical and mental wellbeing."
11843,"No chances of strokes, cancer, heart attack and blood clots.Easier removal than an implant, as in no need to slice anything open, just open your legs lol."
11844,I was on the IUD for almost 4 years however it fell out the first time as I using my abdomen muscles to push.
11845,"Tried again for another 6 months where it fell out again, Im guessing as a simple push now will trigger it to slip?"
11846,Weirdly enough I still recommend it and Id go back on it as I havent had any issues during those years.
11847,It was blissful.
11848,"The reason why I am not on it, is because I am trying the combined pill and I hate to say it but its managing my mood swings a lot better (I think?"
11849,).If the pill fails Id go back without a second thought.
11850,My other experience with a different contraception was the injection and that ruined me.
11851,"Personally Id say everyones bodies are different therefore you may find the IUD is amazing for you or not, similar to how Ive been avoiding the pill for x amount of reasons, theres aspects of it that has been incredibly beneficial such as regular and less painful periods."
11852,Someone did say on this post that you only ever hear the negative stories of anything.
11853,People with great experience wont feel the need to talk about it.
11854,because its an option
11855,I still don't get why they choose birth control that requires procedures over a vaginal ring that can be used continuously with full control of insertion and removal
11856,"The implanon is tested and made for women up to a certain weight (I think its around 90100kgs) so women who are above that weight probably wont get a high enough dosage of progesterone (leading to it not being as effective for birth control, irregular bleeding etc."
11857,")and I think its also a risk of getting bumped and breaking, whereas the risks associated with an IUD are actually very rare, we just see the horror stories more!"
11858,"I had the Mirena IUD, the reason I chose it was because the lower dose of hormone actually makes it the one of the only safe hormonal birth control options I have (I have porphyria and cannot, for example, take the pill)."
11859,"I feel like many people choose an IUD for similar reasons, it can be a lower dose of hormones, less artificial hormones in your bloodstream, which can also lessen side effects, compared to larger doses in other types of birth control."
11860,"Im no doctor or expert, I definitely havent researched all the options out there fully, but for me I talked with my doctor and opted for the Mirena."
11861,I have sisters and friends that have gotten the Mirena and had great experiences with it.
11862,"Personally, it wasnt for me, I had side effects (I had light albeit prolonged bleeding for over a year and a half, and always spotting/bleeding except for maybe a week out of the month just wasnt for me, plus I had a lot of abdominal pain and it negatively affected my moodbut Im a highly sensitive person and I decided I was going to go a nonhormonal route)."
11863,"I actually started using Natural Cycles and sync it with my Oura ring for data collection (not about having to take my temperature every morning) and its worked to successfully prevent pregnancy for a year and a half, and I felt so much better after removal of the IUD."
11864,"The IUD was nice, I never had to think about birth control, but honestly Natural Cycles has been  pretty low effort and for me its totally worth it, I dont see myself using anything else (until my partner gets snipped after we have kids, but thats like a good decade down the road)."
11865,"I preferred to avoid systemic hormones, which is how the nexplanon arm implant works."
11866,"With the hormonal IUDs, even though they do have hormones they stay more localized which means fewer systemic hormonal effects."
11867,"Plus they last longer, like others have mentioned )"
11868,I love mine.
11869,I've heard about bad side effects friends have had with the implant.
11870,"Blood clots, irregular periods, immense weight gain."
11871,It wasn't worth the risk
11872,Personally I have been in a car accident with someone that had an implant and had her completely freak out over if it was okay immediately.
11873,the risk of having all the hormones release or it break and get displaced is scary.
11874,I also know plenty of women personally that were okay until they started spotting or bleeding for months and months straight.
11875,Id rather have something restricted to one place that can check with a low low dose of hormones.
11876,My insertion wasnt bad at all.
11877,It just felt uncomfortable and I needed otc pain meds and a heated blanket for like 4 hours and I havent had issues since the initial bleeding stopped
11878,"The implant carries a risk of entering the blood stream and causing lifethreatening complicationsThe implant has a higher chance of causing blood clotsThe implant works by delivering hormones to the body, which can cause undesired side effectsIUD stands for intrauterine device, which only refers to the copper coil, aka ParaGard."
11879,IUS stands for intrauterine system which refers to any brand of uterine implant that uses hormones rather than copper.I chose ParaGard because I dont want to use hormonal birth control.
11880,Most other users choose it for the same reason.
11881,"Its the only nonhormonal method on the market besides barrier methods and sterilization, all of which come with greater risks."
11882,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.
11883,Questions?
11884,"First read the Mistake or Pregnancy Risk sticky( or the Consolidated Experience post( If this is an experience post please consider adding it to the listPlanned Parenthood online chat(The rules and additional resources can be found on the About / Sidepage (desktop users look to the right and Reddit app up top).I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
11885,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
11886,Gyno scared me out of it.
11887,They told me there was a higher risk of weight gain with the implant than the IUD (honestly have no clue if thats true).
11888,Also less hormones with the IUD I chose.
11889,I have a clotting disorder so the only thing i can have is the copper iud
11890,"I switched to Essure, but I had the Paragard for a few years."
11891,"I preferred it over the implant because Paragard is nonhormonal, whereas the implant is hormonal."
11892,Paragard also lasts 10 years.
11893,"For me, the depo made me the spawn of Satan and had horrendous irregular bleeding."
11894,"I couldnt remember to take pills to save my life, and the arm implant gave me the heebie jeebies lolIve had Mirena twice now (took our first one to get pregnant), and I LOVE them."
11895,"I had my first for 3 years before removing, got pregnant 2 weeks after removal."
11896,Ive had my second one a little over a year.
11897,It hasnt stopped my periods but has lightened them by a LOT!
11898,I had Kyleena placed twice and both times my uterus rejected it within 2 weeks of placement.
11899,"Then decided for Nexplanon and it worked, but it caused me to get irregular periods which I hated."
11900,"Once it expired, i never got it back in."
11901,A few years later I got pregnant.
11902,"After I had my son, I decided to try Mirena."
11903,So far no issues.
11904,I have a really light period now.
11905,I dont think the implant was available or offered to me when I first got my IUD.
11906,"But I LOVE my IUD, its incredible for me, it works great with my body, no periods, no one and its one of my favourite things.The ones with bad experiences are always going to be the ones who speak out more so what we hear is skewed to be negative."
11907,The majority of women have good experiences with IUDs but obviously the bad experiences sound pretty awful.I have so many friends with IUDs and aside from a few with continuous bleeding but thats it as far as horror stories I know.
11908,"I prefer utilizing the contraceptive method of disrupting implantation, basically a mechanical contraceptive."
11909,It's just simpler.
11910,Hormones were fine with me but I am not paying hundreds to risk messing with it via implant or even hormonal IUD.
11911,Plus I vape nicotine so best to avoid estrogenics.
11912,"And economically, Paraguard can't be beaten."
11913,"Since my period is very regular, I'd like to keep it that way for my monthly ""not pregnant"" alarm."
11914,"If I lost my period and my contraception failed, I could be really screwed or it would just be very expensive if I only learned after a medication abortion."
11915,"My IUD insertion was painful but not the worst, the pain quickly subsided, my cramps immediately became significantly less intense each month so it was a good trade."
11916,I've personally heard horror stories about both that have turned me away from either of those options.
11917,I've been on the patch.
11918,It's longerlasting and the hormonal ones can reduce or eliminate periods.
11919,Not having a period is awesome.
11920,Just got my implant removed after the worst experience ever.
11921,I gained 15 pounds in 3 months  no change in diet or routine.
11922,My breasts got a cup bigger.
11923,"I had severe breast sensitivity because of it, putting on a bra hurt."
11924,I was crying every other day because everything set me off.
11925,I bled for 6 months straight not just spotting.
11926,"After the 6 months, I would only get a 1.5 week break before 2 week periods began again."
11927,I had it for about 9 months and couldnt take it anymore.
11928,Now IUD?
11929,"Insertion is horrible, I cramp for a day or two afterwards."
11930,I get cramps during my phantom period as I call it.
11931,I only bleed a few days every couple months and its spotting at most.
11932,I get cramps which I didnt before but thats it.
11933,I had the IUD for 3 years and never noticed symptoms.
11934,"Once I got it removed, I realized discomfort in certain positions was caused by it but otherwise I was fine."
11935,Back on it and couldnt be happier.
11936,Still have to lose my implant weight
11937,My situation was a bit out of the ordinary but I had heavy continual bleeding on the implant and eventually had it taken out when it only got worse each month.
11938,I did have breakthrough bleeding with the IUD but it became regular after 3ish months as it was supposed to.
11939,"Whatever works for you is the best thing and mine just turned out to be the IUD, if I had to do it all again I still think the logical choice was getting the implant so I genuinely wish it couldve worked out but"
11940,"I would love the implant, but i'm too scared of the side effects."
11941,Currently on the pill that has been amazing for me.
11942,"With the implant I had insane mood swings and felt crazy, had no libido, and gained a lot of weight."
11943,"I have the copper iud now and I have a rougher period but aside from that, no issues."
11944,Just goes to show that what works and doesnt differs with every person!
11945,"My horror story is with Nexplanon, it was awful."
11946,Every time my partner came inside me it would set off heavy breakthrough bleeding that would last for several weeks.
11947,"When that would stop, we would not use a condom and the process would start all over."
11948,"When I made an appointment with my OBGYN about removing it, all she had to say was suck it up, at least youre not pregnant Thankfully I switched providers after her, and my new OBGYN has been much more focused on finding answers."
11949,"I chose a hormonal IUD, Kyleena, I have endometriosis so I need the hormones to help with inflammation!"
11950,"I have heard super mixed things about the implant and tbh just scared of it, i have also used the pill before but wanted something more reliable I love my IUD, i have had it for a little over a year and absolutely will be getting another put it when its time is up."
11951,"my main side effect for periods is i get a day of cramping about a week before the actual gush, which is annoying in the moment but is a really nice mental note that my period is coming."
11952,"period wise, its only 34 days, super light, definitely not as bad as it used to be, no complaints on my end )"
11953,"The one I have, Im getting ready to stop using it."
11954,Its coming next month and its in my left arm.
11955,That was the only one I one would work just in case.
11956,"I got all the information I needed before hand, even started on the pill first to get my body ready."
11957,From my experience the only change Ive witnessed is my weight gain and my attitude a bit.
11958,When I recently went to the gyno I needed to get on birth control hormones to help cysts on my ovaries.
11959,I mentioned the implant and he said that there are studies where they are more likely to cause an increase with breast cancer.
11960,Due to the cysts I am already at a higher risk which is why he decided on the patch.
11961,"Idk if that is why so many doctors and women go for the IUD, but it would be something to consider."
11962,"in high school i had a friend whos implant got lost in her arm and i think her explaining what they did to try and find it traumatized me, ive never even thought about getting it lol."
11963,although i think if i had heard a bad story about IUDs around that time im sure i would have the same feeling about them.
11964,i think some things just like stick with you lol
11965,I bled the entire 3 years with the implant.
11966,"Every fucking day now I have the IUD and get a ""period"" every 2 months that's only spotting."
11967,It's preferable and makes sex way more enjoyable.
11968,I have no complaints about the IUD that would ever make me go back to nexplanon
11969,"Prior to getting my iud, I heard lots of positive things about them."
11970,I knew some people who had the implant and it was not good stories.
11971,My iud insertion was quick and painless.
11972,"I havent had problems except for bleeding thats gone on for a month, but Im not too upset about it."
11973,Plus I like that its not something I have to remember to take often like the pill and itll last a good couple of years
11974,"I bled for 6 months straight with an implant, didnt get my period once with an IUD."
11975,"IUDs have a lower dose of hormones and the dose is more localised to the uterus so you dont experience as many side affects, typically anyway, of course it varies from person to person."
11976,Meh.
11977,Its the only nonhormonal choice that appealed to me and it lasts 10 years.
11978,"Frankly, Ive read more horror stories re hormonal implants and BC pills."
11979,Its a no from me
11980,"My doctor said that a lot of women get their implant removed early because of irregular bleeding, so I choose an IUD."
11981,I have mirena so don't get a period.
11982,"IUDs last longer, my body doesnt react well at all to hormones, I personally dont want a scar, the process seems even more painful to me, among other things!"
11983,Glad its working for you though!
11984,"out of my close friends and family, most of them have had worse experiences with the implant (constant bleeding, incorrect insertion, trouble with removal)."
11985,i got copper iud because its non hormonal which was very attractive.
11986,havent had it for very long but im loving it so far
11987,No hormones!
11988,Agreed.
11989,I had two failed insertion attempts with the same doctor and I think they just didnt get my downstairs or were just bad.
11990,I then went to a specialist gynaecologist who used ultrasound first and it has been superb since.
11991,"I still recommend to my friends, but UK wise if your clinic cant guarantee an ultrasound first, then Id suggest going private like I did."
11992,I wanted an implant but my gyno told me they don't typically do implants anymore unless it's on people with severe mental handicaps who need birth control (cause it's less invasive to place and check up on) or if your body rejects IUD's.
11993,I still wish I could get an implant though cause I'd much rather be able to see the thing and know it's still there.
11994,"I ended up getting Nexplanon because the doctor recommended it over an IUD because I hadn't yet experienced extreme period cramps, and she thought the pain of insertion would be too much.Honestly?"
11995,I haven't had any issues with it other than the normal birth control libido loss and irregular periods.
11996,I am currently on my second implant and I don't even notice it.
11997,A lot of people have Nexplanon horror stories but I've found it really great for me personally.
11998,I got the IUD a year ago because the implant in my arm didn't speak to me.
11999,And I liked the low hormone idea of Kyleena.
12000,"Fast forward a year later, it's been hell sometimes but I'm really happy with the IUD because it's convenient and sometimes I almost forget it's there."
12001,Aaand I'm protected against babies for 5 years.
12002,But I heard that you can still feel the implant and that it disappears sometimes?
12003,So that kind of scared me.
12004,"Anyway, I started taking raspberry leaf pills for the pain and it's really working."
12005,So I recommend it to all my IUD girlies.
12006,I had the implant first.
12007,Had to have it removed due to period not stopping.
12008,It was horrible.
12009,Now have iud wo issue.
12010,I've had the implant since I was 16 I'm not 38 that's a lot of replacements iver the years and I just got fed up on the pain and bruising after a changeover.
12011,the copper IUD is also a good option for those who want hormonalfree bc !
12012,The arm implant gave me a neurological condition sooooo
12013,"When I had a Paragard IUD, I loved it!"
12014,It was my first and only form on BC.
12015,Then I went onto get sterilized and had my IUD removed.
12016,Hi!
12017,Not a woman.
12018,"However, I chose the (hormonal) iud because it had a higher reported chance of having the desired effect (stopping or lessening periods), and the implant being known to make irregular/heavy bleeding much worse, seemed like the worse option."
12019,"Plus, the iud lasts longer, and I dont feel it unless Im actively checking for the strings, whereas with the implant I would personally be driving myself insane touching it in my arm all the time."
12020,because i didnt want a method that used hormones
12021,I got the copper coil because hormone BC turned me into a lunatic
12022,I cant have anything hormonal including the implant so the copper IUD is my only option.
12023,"I cant have anything with oestrogen in, and progesterone caused me to be so dry I couldnt have sex and caused me to have reoccurring yeast infections."
12024,So its my only option.
12025,But tbf its been the best thing Ive done.
12026,Insertion wasnt painful for me and Ive had no problems with it.
12027,"Periods are fine, all be it slightly heavier."
12028,"I had 2 friends get the implant, and they went horribly wrong."
12029,"One person was told it was sintered correctly, and everything was fine."
12030,They waited the time period to be covered before doing the do.
12031,"A few weeks later it forced its way out of her arm, and she ended up pregnant."
12032,My other friend had a horribly painfil insertion and increasingly heavy periods that became debilitating when they never had period problems before.
12033,So I decided it wasn't for me.
12034,I also started with the Mirena and had to have it removed because it was to large and was rubbing my ovary and causing contraction like pains.
12035,Im on the Kyleena now and 100 no problems.
12036,Ive had 2 different iuds.
12037,"The first one was a nightmare, the second one, Mirena, has been almost perfect."
12038,Ive had little to no problems other than being really weepy at the beginning and end of my very light period.
12039,the implant made me gain a ridiculous amount of weight and fucked up my face acne wise.
12040,the iud (at least the copper one) has no affect on me.
12041,you can tell who the clear winner for me is.
12042,"plus, copper lasts 12 years."
12043,ill be damned before i get pregnant in my 20s
12044,I didn't want a scar on my arm.
12045,The implant made me bleed heavily so I can't use it.
12046,Im halfway through my second Mirena.
12047,"When I first got it placed all those years ago, I bled almost everyday for a solid 6 months."
12048,"I do have endometriosis, so Id take 6 months of light almost painless bleeding compared to extremely heavy bleeding with intense pain that lasted 710 days every month."
12049,I eventually didnt have a period and would randomly spot.
12050,"Ive started to have more breakthrough bleeding recently, but my gynecologist said its probably from stress."
12051,I was also diagnosed with PCOS this year and started other meds for that which Im sure caused some of the bleeding as well.
12052,"I had an allergic reaction to my implant, my arm swelled up  itched, and the entire area over the implant turned into a gross hive/blister.IUD was ok but I was having debilitating cramps so I got it removed.Now we just do fertility awareness/condoms etc."
12053,"I had the implant for 8 years, it was great until it wasnt."
12054,The hormones really fucked with me.
12055,"I have Mirena now since 2020 and its been perfect, other than the barbaric insertion!"
12056,I chose the cooper iud for no hormones.
12057,No horror stories here.
12058,I had it for 4 years.
12059,"Insertion wasn't the most pleasant thing, but the pain was over after 40 seconds."
12060,"I wanted a nonhormonal option, and it's been great."
12061,No period  I dont have to worry about contraception until 2030.
12062,Hormones are localized.
12063,All my doctor friends chose Mirena for their own bodies.
12064,It was a nobrainer for me!
12065,"I got the IUD because I have PCOS, and my gynecologist said it would help cysts to pop."
12066,"Tbh, Im really glad I got it."
12067,Its been my best birth control so far.
12068,"Ive had no side effects, and I havent had to deal with a period for a little over a year now."
12069,I really like my IUD  this is my second one and its been my only form of contraception for about 5 years now.
12070,"Having it put in was deffo painful but I felt able to handle it, and for me its like 2 mins of pain (and then an afternoon/evening of mild cramping) for 35 years of having very very effective contraception and having my periods be SIGNIFICANTLY lighter and easier to manage."
12071,"Ive got girlfriends irl who have had bad luck with the iud, but Ive actually known far more that have hated the implant."
12072,"Two people I know in real life just bled on it continuously, one so much so she became anaemic."
12073,"Overall though, different things work for different people Id say."
12074,"I get 0 hormonal side effects on the coil (compared to being borderline suicidal on the pill) and I cant stand the idea of something being inserted under my skin lol, but thats me personally."
12075,"My sister has the IUD and swears by it, Im just paranoid of the insertion and horror stories Ive read, so thats why I got nexplanon."
12076,"I personally love it, the first year I had no period."
12077,"Then it regulated every month until now (I have two years left on it), Ive never been regular my entire life until I had nexplanon, now I have it every month."
12078,But overall I love it.
12079,My IUD is nonhormonal.
12080,I got the copper IUD because my body doesnt do well with hormonal BC.
12081,Absolutely love it!
12082,I chose a copper IUD because its non hormonal and my bf can still cum inside me.
12083,no hormones.
12084,hormones made me feel like shit and killed my sex drive.
12085,"the iud isnt all too terrible, at least mine wasnt!"
12086,getting it inserted wouldnt be something id do for fun but it didnt kill me.
12087,it did make my periods about 100x worse half the time though.
12088,simply the trade off i suppose
12089,"I went with the copper IUD because its the only nonhormonal option, I was scared to get the implant because Id had such a rough time on the pill and didnt want to have something with hormones implanted in me just in case it had a similar effect."
12090,The implant made me want to walk off a roof.
12091,The Paragard doesn't.
12092,That made it easy for me lol
12093,"The implant has a much higher level of hormones than any hormonal IUDs, essentially because they need to travel within the body as opposed to IUDs which can release a much lower localized amount.This info comes from a few Drs over the years who have advised me to try and IUD since my own terrible experience with the implant."
12094,I havent yet taken them up on it (partially because Im now pregnant on purpose).The implant made me so anxious and depressed that I nearly cut it out of my arm with a kitchen knife when my removal appointment couldnt be scheduled soon enough.
12095,"I also bleed the whole time, but that paled in comparison to the mental/emotional side effects for me."
12096,"I am traumatized enough that I will not only take the mini pill because I can control when to stop it if needed, I dont need to wait for medical removal.That being said, I have friends whove loved their implants which is why I tried it initially, so it really depends on the person and annoyingly its trial and error!"
12097,"In my experience with many Reddit pages, people are usually going to be more likely to share bad or poor experiences with a product or thing, rather than the positive ones."
12098,So I think youre seeing mostly IUD horror stories because those are the ones that are more likely to be shared )
12099,implant made me depressed and had thoughts of unaliving myself everyday and anger issues.
12100,i hate the implant so much.
12101,i feel mentally and emotionally myself on the copper IUD but the period pain is unbearable and my bf and i no longer have sex because the iud strings hurt lmfao D
12102,I chose the IUD because it lasts longer than the implant and there is no need to remember to replace it like with the ring.
12103,Added benefit my doctor told me was the hormones mainly stay local rather than being systemic like with other forms of birth control like the pill which is a pain to remember to take at the same time daily.
12104,Ive also had friends who had the implant and they absolutely hated it because of irregular bleeding and its side effects.
12105,"Ive had the implant before and had no periods with it , which was great but i hated the weight gain."
12106,Im a little vain about my appearance so i will say that kind of brought my self esteem down.I switched over to the non hormonal IUD.
12107,I love the copper.
12108,"The first month i gotta say was kinda rough, but my body is now adjusting well , also Ive slowly been loosing the weight."
12109,"Its non hormonal, Im on some heavy medication and it would mess me up."
12110,Also it last longer
12111,"Implant made me bleed for two weeks at a time, HEAVY, about every 3 months."
12112,Too weird.
12113,"But that isnt what made me vow to never get it again, the removal process was so gross."
12114,I had built up scar tissue so it took a while and bled a lot.
12115,Not painful but just upsetting and uncomfortable I guess?
12116,"Never had an IUD tho Im terrified, just a pill girlie for now."
12117,My IUD (the Kyleena) worked as intended for 5 years straight but the insertion was nothing short of horrific.
12118,"I picked it over the implant at the time because it cost just as much as the implant but it lasted me 5 years rather than 3 so more bang for your buck (pun intended).Going for an arm implant next because I want local anesthesia, bummer that I won't be able to check the placement myself anymore like I used to be able to with the IUD!"
12119,In Brazil implants are very expensives and aren't covered by insurance.
12120,"DIU is accessible, you can get it on SUS, our free healthcare system or by insurance."
12121,I had 2 mirenas for 13 years and never had a period or any issues.
12122,I even got pregnant the month I took it out.
12123,So I always recommend them.
12124,But the lilleta I got after having my son I bleed all the time and my hormones are out of whack.
12125,I want it out.
12126,My daughter on the other hand had a nexplanon and bled constantly.
12127,She just got a lilleta and is bleeding with it now too.
12128,It's strange.
12129,I am now wonder if lilleta are more different than they claim bc I never had issues with the mirena now both of us are having issues with the lilleta.
12130,"Implant made bleeding worse, irregular and extra painful."
12131,"Iud reduces mu seizures, bleeding and migraines."
12132,Mostly because not everyone has a horror story IUD experience.
12133,"Before I got mine, I was panicked about how painful it was going to be."
12134,My doctor sat me down and walked me through every step before hand.
12135,"Then when inserting, she did the same thing."
12136,She also mentioned how people will read the horror stories and build up a lot of anxiety during the procedure.
12137,Which this may cause it to feel more painful then it is.
12138,"During and after the insertion, I felt nothing."
12139,Like maybe a small pressure at one point of it.
12140,And now my periods have been gone for over two years with it.
12141,"I had maybe a day of cramping after having it, but even then my period where worst then those."
12142,"I also had an two different implants in my arm before the IUD, and I will say the pain during inserting and removing those was more."
12143,And that is mostly from the injection of the numbing.
12144,"My experience was semi great with those, but my period never went away."
12145,"And then my body just completely stop working with it.Overall, the IUD is not painful for a lot of people."
12146,"When getting one, it is best to go to a doctor that your trust and to avoid reading to many horror stories before hand."
12147,"Obviously, people will still have negative experiences with it but that doesn't mean that happens for everyone."
12148,Implant can dislodge and end up in your heart.
12149,IUD has a fully hormone free option.
12150,Honestly I chose it because they offered to put it in during a laproscopy.
12151,"Turns out the implant I did have had migrated into the muscle and wasn't actually working, they had to cut it out and now my bicep is fucked and still hurts."
12152,I have the copper iud because hormones make me crazy.
12153,"I mean, Im still slightly crazy but its manageable."
12154,"Also it lasts way longer, I think 10 years or something"
12155,"Personally its because the ones who pump hormones in your whole body (depo shot, most notably) made me a wreck and I didnt even feel like myself."
12156,"I was mean and aggressive with crazy mood swings, gained a ton of weight, and my face was breaking out every single day."
12157,"I got the kyleena IUD and bc the hormone release is limited to just the uterus, my head and my face are clear, my periods are few and far in between, and overall its just a much better experience."
12158,Plus it lasts like 5 years.
12159,Positive IUD experience my first experience was garbage bc my doctor was an asshole who didnt tell me what was going on and I was like 17.
12160,"BUT for my second one I went to a female gyno, I explained my first experience and she gave me a local anesthetic AND a tranquilizer pill for me to take before the appointment."
12161,"She was super kind, explained everything as she did it, and gave me stuff to do while she was replacing it to help with the pain (pro tip pushing down on your uterus during insertion, kind of like when you have really really bad cramps, really helps the pain!)"
12162,Having a kind doctor who doesnt dismiss your pain is key.
12163,every person I know who's gotten the implant has had issues.
12164,every person who i know who has had an IUD has not had issues.
12165,"I know this is all ancedotal but the choice for me was a no brainer, and I love my IUD."
12166,"I've never had a single problem with it, with the exception of insertion pain and a cramp every once in awhile."
12167,I had a decent cycle so I didn't want to have to deal with hormones messing that up.
12168,I'm on the copper iud
12169,Ive had both.
12170,I had the implant at first and was so excited to not have to take a pill everyday but I developed bad nerve damage from it.
12171,I know it wont happen to everyone so dont freak out lol.
12172,I had it in for exactly a week around last year and most of the nerve pain and damage has gone away but sometimes if my arm is just in the right place I will feel it again.
12173,It was like a hot needle of electricity was shooting down my arm and it would be so bad I would cry.
12174,I couldnt use my arm for the whole week and had to keep it in a sling so I wouldnt move it.
12175,After I got it removed I went back to pills for a long time and I recently got an iud the first week was hell.
12176,I was in such bad pain and cramping.
12177,I just kept waiting because everything I saw said it would get better and it did.
12178,I still do get periods but a lot lighter than I used to.
12179,"Ive had it for two months now going on three and its so much better not as much cramping just regular period cramps and occasional spotting but Im hoping that will subside as time goes on, because it has already gotten better."
12180,I got the non hormonal one (paraguard) ten years ago and its been great.
12181,I have PCOS so almost all hormonal BC messes me up something good.
12182,Only setback is my partner can feel it once a month when my cervix drops.
12183,They dont really mind tho and its really a non issue.
12184,Had heavy periods for three months and def cramping when inserted.
12185,Ill probably get another one next year and only remove if we ever try for kids.
12186,I personally love it and cant recommend it enough as a long term user.
12187,Ive heard worse horror stories from the implant than the iud.
12188,Plus acne and weight gain are common side effects of the implant so it was an immediate no for me.
12189,"i had the implant for all three years, i never got the insane months long period side effects in fact i only got my period maybe 4 times the entire time?"
12190,"but personally it made my anxiety terrible, i switched to a copper iud two years ago and i have yet to have a problem with it."
12191,I loved having and IUD  its what I used  from college to menopause.
12192,I wanted to get an implant but my doctor said that because of my severe cramps that the implant would not help with it the way an IUD would.
12193,"I haven't had my period since one month after I got it, but I hear a lot of people get irregular bleeding with nexplanon."
12194,According to my Dr. the implant has A LOT more progesterone than any of the hormonal IUDs.
12195,If you have a negative reaction to the progesterone its probably going to be worse with an implant.I had the implant for about a year and got it taken out because it made me gain a lot of weight very quickly and gave me some of the worst acne Ive had since high school.
12196,Both of which (according to my Dr.) were most likely related to the amount of progesterone.With the IUD the hormones are more localized to your uterus (I have afab trans masc friends who used it while on hrt to keep their uteruses healthy).
12197,So that also makes it less likely to cause other side effects.
12198,At the end of the day it comes down to what youre looking for out of bc (besides not getting pregnant ) because different hormone levels will have different affects on different symptoms and bodies.
12199,"I have kyleena, I have regular periods every month and it's been 34 years."
12200,I didn't even know the implant was a thing at the time.
12201,The implant was not approved for use in Canada when I got my IUD.
12202,"It is now, but I think if I dont want kids once my IUD expires, Ill just get another one."
12203,For some reason the idea of a plastic thing embedded in my arm freaks me out more than a plastic thing embedded in my uterus.
12204,Weird lol
12205,The implant sent me loopy and got it out early .
12206,The copper iud has been the best choice Ive ever made ( although it was the worst pain I have ever been through )
12207,i just switched to an iud from the implant.
12208,"the implant gave me excruciating cramps, extremely heavy bleeding and awful bloating."
12209,"i couldn't handle it so i switched, and so far i LOVE my iud."
12210,"im mostly just spotting here and there, still have bad cramps but im just glad im not bleeding heavily and CONSTANTLY anymore."
12211,When I had the implant I had crippling pain every month alongside excessive bleeding.
12212,With the Mirena I barely get a period.
12213,"I actually cant take hormonal birth control that works through your blood stream due to another medication I am on, but I can have the hormonal IUD so its the only long term birth control I can really do!"
12214,"I had an implant, it was fine."
12215,"I got a second one and had a three year period, and at the end of it, they couldnt locate the implant and had to do exploratory surgery to remove it, under anesthesia, which cost an arm and a leg."
12216,"I only used pills for a few years after that, until I got put on a medication that made oral contraceptives less effective (Topamax) and settled with an IUD."
12217,I had nexplanon twice and LOVED it.
12218,Would totally get it again if I was skinnier.
12219,"My second implant got kinda.. buried.. in my arm fat (recovery from an ED, I was literally skin and bones when I got the implants in) and I had to have it removed in hospital."
12220,The experience was a total breeze and I would do it again in a heartbeat but now I have to pay for insurance and medical procedures so I think if I had to go that route again Id be screwed financially lol.
12221,I got the IUD because its another set and forget type of birth control and it lasts a long time.
12222,"Thats all I was looking for in a birth control, something I couldnt fuck up"
12223,I think people tend to switch over when I discuss the bleeding patterns with the implant.
12224,I personally went for the IUD because it was going through a hole I already naturally have rather than creating a scar for entry and removal.
12225,"IUDs and the arm implant are equally effective at preventing pregnancy (roughly 99), so there's no real need to consider vasectomy besides greater peace of mind."
12226,Though keep in mind that vasectomies are not totally reversible if you do plan on having bio kids at some point.
12227,"A lot of people think it's an easy thing, but the success rate of reversal and sperm quality goes down every year after the procedure."
12228,I had the arm implant had a continuous period for 6 months I couldnt handle it so I got it it and got the iud
12229,I choose IUD because I dont want to mess with my hormones in any way Ive never been on any hormonal birth control my whole life!
12230,I have heard more horror stories about that then the IUD.
12231,My doctor is even letting me go under to get it inserted this time!
12232,I got mirena 3 months postpartum after my firstborn.
12233,I had previously been on the pill for 7 years prior and didn't realize how awful of a person it had turned me into until I stopped it to get pregnant.
12234,"My biggest concern with any form of birth control was I did not want to be that awful, depressed, anxious person again.My providers were very clear about what side effects each method of birth control could have and went through each one with me until we decided on the mirena instead of the paragard because the paragard can cause some women to have a heavier flow and worse cramping and I already had both of those pretty badly so I didn't want to make it worse.I was terrified because my sister in law actually had emergency surgery to remove her IUD a few years ago so I knew firsthand the problems that could arise but they went through all my concerns with me and I felt very comfortable with my decision.I had an emergency c section so I had Norco left over that I took prior to the insertion so I didn't feel a thing."
12235,Afterwards there was definitely cramping but nothing that Tylenol didn't help.After getting through the first like 6 months of random spotting I can very very confidently say I will never use another form of birth control but the mirena.
12236,"I felt like myself, it didn't affect me sex drive, my skin cleared up, I did not gain any weight, I had no periods (I was also nursing for 1.5 years after insertion though so take that with a grain of salt) and I literally couldn't even tell it was there."
12237,And totally TMI but my husband is on the larger side while I'm very small and even he never noticed it was there (which was another concern because I've heard of men getting impaled during sex).
12238,I literally cannot say enough good things about it.
12239,"Just the fact that I felt like myself still rather than the person the pill made me into made it worth it to me.Also, I just got it out earlier this year to try for baby 2 and read online that if you take like a couple Tylenol and ibuprofen it makes it easier and not only was that true, but removal was literally a second long."
12240,"Like she asked if I was ready, counted to 3, pulled quickly and it was out before I even realized."
12241,And I was terrified going in.Bottom line is if you're a person that struggles with depression and anxiety and feel like you're not yourself when you're on birth control I'd fully recommend the hormonal IUD.
12242,"But again, like everyone is saying, everyone is different so you never know how you're going to respond."
12243,Most if not all insurances do cover IUD insertion and removal though and there's no penalty for taking it out early if you don't like it.
12244,"I was bleeding all the time, painful cramps, my libido sank deeper than Marianas trench, made my anxiety worse and gained weight."
12245,Everyone is different of course but this was my experience!
12246,I had Nexplanon for two years and experienced awful awful side effects.
12247,"I gained 30 lbs, extremely irregular and excessive bleeding (sometimes with bleeding lasting as long as 60 days), very intense mood swings."
12248,"I didnt feel like myself on it.I switched to Skyla IUD, I just got it replaced so Im on my second one."
12249,Insertion is painful but I feel protected and have had virtually no notable side effects.
12250,The amount of hormones is less in an IUD that implant because its local to the uterus.
12251,Thats why some women seem to have less severe side effects with IUD vs. implant.
12252,"I was going to get my Nexplanon, but chose not to."
12253,"However, I learned from my gynocologist that the hormones from the hormonal IUDs are localized, so any emotional side effects are likely not due to the hormones themselves."
12254,"Some women do still have emotional side effects, though, which I theorize are due to the changes in the uterus."
12255,I had the implant for six years and hormonally its the best method Ive used thus far.
12256,"However, because it sits between two major muscles in the arm, if your insertion isnt done correctly, then replacing or removing it can leave your arm absolutely wrecked."
12257,I was stuck with someone digging between my bicep and tricep with nothing but novocaine for 45 minutes.
12258,At that point you dont feel any pain but you can still feel whats going on when the implant ends up embedded in your muscle tissue.
12259,"So, I mean, thats quite a horror story if you ask me."
12260,I love my IUD.
12261,I would never try anything else (as long as it doesnt perforate my uterus before I get rid of it)
12262,I got the (hormonal)IUD and have had weird ass irregular yet almost constant light bleeding since I got it over a year ago  I have like reverse periods now where I'll randomly get a week where I don't bleed lmao
12263,"Meanwhile me, the clown, spotting every other week with Mirena.At least with the copper, even though it was a blood flood, it had a definite start and end point."
12264, Implant is notorious for irregular bleeding and I cant deal with that.Same here.
12265,For me a big part of the appeal of a LARC was that it would probably stop my bleeding.
12266,I was willing to put up with some pain to get that benefit.
12267,I have the implant and I dont have any bleeding at all!
12268,"Granted, everyones body responds differently."
12269,"Also, the hormonal IUDs have the exact same hormones as the implant."
12270,Theyre just localized.
12271,Id like to hear some positive experiences as I have been fear mongered by those stories of negative experiences
12272,Ive found that people really love to share anecdotal bad experiences with BC to show that BC is bad.
12273,"While sharing the side effects should be done, people have had BC help them so much and its just fear mongering at this point."
12274,Same.
12275,My doctor has always been great whenever I visit her.
12276,Same.
12277,Ive had 2 Mirenas so far.
12278,Best decision of my life.
12279,First one was a bit painful.
12280,Second was a breeze.
12281,No horror stories tho
12282,I have the paragard  I LOVE IT.
12283,No hormones so I have extremely regular periods.
12284,My body has adjusted so I dont get bad acne anymore either.
12285,Had Mirena it worked well.
12286,Had constant spotting the entire 3 years.
12287,Along with acne and weight fluctuations.
12288,Stuck with an iud bc I was interested in a reliable non hormonal BC.
12289,it works WONDERS.
12290,Never had a scare  my husband  I Never use protection.
12291,Insertion does hurt.
12292,But the pain only lasted about 35 days.
12293,Paragard had really heavy periods  6 months
12294,I am on year six of the nonhormonal IUD.
12295,Positive but unremarkable is quite right!
12296,"The reason I chose this one is because I was very lucky with periods before 34 days and irregular, with maybe some back pain but little else."
12297,"I didnt want that to change by taking hormones, so I chose the ParaGuard.Downsides it did make my flow more intense and my cramps more intense, but not debilitating."
12298,"When I told my pcp, she was very coldthis was a symptom that you were told could and most likely would happen."
12299,You had other options for birth control.
12300,"I changed my pcp, but my symptoms are manageable now that I know which signals to look for that my period is coming."
12301,I didnt know what to look for before!
12302,"tbh so much has happened over the past few years that Im glad I wasnt adding on bc hormones on top of it all, Ive heard good and bad from friends and my mom, and she had six kids."
12303,no thanks
12304,Yes so true!
12305,I recently posted about my good experience and got totally trashed by people who had a horrible experience and they said I was invalidating their story.
12306,When Im reality I just wanted to share my point that not everyone struggles.
12307,I got copper IUD and its the best decision Ive done
12308,"Mine was painful, bordering on cyst level, but I wouldn't call it a horror story."
12309,"The worst part was hearing my gyno say ""The clamps keep falling off your cervix."""
12310,I just remind myself it is a lot quicker and less painful than childbirth.
12311,Now those are horror stories.
12312,Indeed!!!
12313,Its not an amazing experience but its not nearly as bad as everyone says.
12314,I got mine in September 2 years ago and it was the best decision ever.
12315,I started having regular periods and now its gone (I thought I was pregnant but nope ahah!).
12316,"No pain, no worries."
12317,And I still have 3 years more with it.
12318,I agree with this.
12319,My mother and sister both had positive experiences so I went and got one and also had a positive experience.
12320,As did my sister in law and a few of my coworkers.
12321,But I also want to allow space for the ones who did have a bad experience.
12322,I love my copper IUD!
12323,"Sure it still kinda sucks having a monthly period, but its gotten much lighter over time and I love having a higher libido."
12324,"The pill actually caused painful sex for me, my OBGYN said it can decrease levels of natural estrogen and essentially cause vaginal atrophy"
12325,Thank you for this!
12326,This is very educational.
12327,"Personally I have hormonal imbalance, so I think thats why the implant worked for me."
12328,I would like to say that the point about the hormones being localised isnt actually accurate.
12329,"It is constantly repeated by those encouraging hormonal IUDs, to be clear Im not blaming you at all here, but it just doesnt work that way."
12330,The hormones dont just stay in the uterus and the side effects tend to be of a very similar nature to the implant.
12331,"The copper IUD is a great option, as long as it stays in place."
12332,"But expulsion is a problem with all IUD types, on balance."
12333,Im really happy its working for you.
12334,"I think youre right that everything will have horror stories, but some methods have particularly high rates of discontinuation and it seems the hormonal LARCs are the types that many women just find unacceptable."
12335,"Theyre also harder to remove and find another method, which should be considered."
12336,"I really think that the issues are downplayed and many women arent properly informed, then are consequently dismissed."
12337,This!
12338,"I guess the implant is only good when it really works for someone, but it looks like most of the time women get heavy bleeding ("
12339,"Also it's set and forget, installation was horrific, but that was five and a half years ago and I have more years left to go."
12340,My friends shudder too whenever the topic of my implant comes up lol.
12341,Its either can I touch it?
12342,or can you point it out for me?
12343,The arm implant was definitely the worst for me.
12344,I had it for four months before I went back to get it out.
12345,"Constant headaches, moodiness, bleeding."
12346,I was 18 at the time.But that was not the horrific part.
12347,The horrific part was that the local anesthetic did not work on me.
12348,Apparently I have a gene that makes me sometimes immune to it.
12349,"It's like Russian roulette, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't."
12350,Not even a little.TRIGGER WARNING.
12351,"It's about to get nasty.So she kept waiting a while and then injecting some more anastatic, but it was just not gonna do anything."
12352,"I told her to just proceed because I wanted to get it over with, even though I could feel literally everything.So, she made an incision in my arm, not the most pleasant feeling but ok. Then she used some sort of tweezers to try to get the little bar out."
12353,That feeling was far worse than the cut.
12354,"It took way longer than I expected and then she said nervously ""I'm sorry, I just can't seem to find it""."
12355,"For context, I was slightly underweight so it's not like I had a lot of arm lol."
12356,She made the cut a little bigger a few times and kept poking inside my arm with the tweezers to find the thingy.
12357,It felt absolutely awful and I almost fainted at some point because of the feeling.
12358,She eventually found it after about 15 minutes of this.
12359,She then gave me the worst stitches in the world (never had em before so had no idea).
12360,So now I'm left with an ugly looking scar instead of a neat line on my arm.
12361,"Btw, I know this was probably a very unique experience and in hindsight she just seemed inexperienced and slightly bad at her job."
12362,"But yea, never again lol."
12363,Oh god same I fucking hate the depo shot lol I gained so much weight lost so much of my hair
12364,Did you get a lot of cravings ?
12365,Thats a hella amount to gain in 6 months.
12366,I woulda been pissed Ive been on depo for 6 months and have kept my weight the same so far but I almost started binge eating cuz of it and noticed right away I got my ass working it out
12367,I'm impressed at what they did for you.
12368,Could you drop where you got your IUD and the name of your doctor?
12369,"Also, was the procedure expensive?"
12370,I wonder if she was that good at inserting them honestly.
12371,To be fair you dont need stitches afterwards
12372,Id say IUD has the implant beat in every area except insertion.
12373,"I much preferred the little arm poke, they did numb me first so I could at least look at the other wall and pretend it wasnt happening."
12374,Ill never stop saying my IUD insertion was absolutely barbaric.
12375,Medieval torture.
12376,"What are the other horror stories with the implant, aside from heavy bleeding?"
12377,Hows your experience been with Kyleena?
12378,Im getting it soon )
12379,Im on my third one  had Mirena now for 13 continuous years.
12380,"One of the three insertions really sucked (the third one, weirdly) but overall its low hassle and I get a shadow of a period like two days every six months or so."
12381,Ill definitely continue getting them.
12382,That's whack because medicaid covered both of my implants.
12383,I heard stories of people bleeding for months and some straight up said its not worth it.
12384,I considered Nexplanon but knowing that there is a possibility that Ill have irregular bleeding turns me off from the idea.
12385,Oh no!
12386,I am constantly sick as well  Could the implant be the reason?
12387,"True, also IUD hormones act locally in the uterus, instead of having the hormones circulate all around your body."
12388,It is very nice to hear from a doctor that the baby holding the IUD is a lie lol.
12389,nexplanon made me suicidal.
12390,anyway ive been on kyleena for a little over 3 years now D
12391,"I considered getting an iud but hearing that it can be painful made me scared, so Im wondering how were you able to avoid that pain?"
12392,Hows your experience been with Kyleena so far?)
12393,I remember on TikTok I saw this woman saying how her gynecologist basically pressured her into getting the depo shot and refused to do an IUD insertion and was saying the depo shot is more effective when thats definitely not true.
12394,I got Implanon!
12395,"Its the only available one here in my country as far as I know (for implants and I also got it for free thanks to healthcare) As I hear a lot of women bleed a lot, I dont get my period at all."
12396,It also helped so much with my cramps and other period commodities I go through.
12397,The only side effect I think I dont like is my skin got dull.
12398,"Im not sure if the implant is to blame, but I still do my skin care but my pores got slightly more visible."
12399,"Why do you think the IUD is less likely to cause strokes, cancer, heart attack and blood clots than the implant?"
12400,"At least for the hormonal IUD, there's zero evidence to suggest that."
12401,"I tried the ring and mine came out almost every time I had sex, so it didn't feel very reliable to me."
12402,Ended up getting a copper IUD (before Nexplanon was widely promoted/available).
12403,Got it removed and it broke upon removal.
12404,"I get to have my gyno fish around for its tiny arm in my uterus next week with only local anesthesia in order to avoid a 4,000 surgery."
12405,Yay!
12406,Now I'm just going back to the pill.
12407,"I liked the ring well enough and definitely better than the combo pills I tried before it but it gave me a blood clot/stroke, so no more estrogen for me."
12408,Silver lining is I've liked both progestin only methods I've used since a tad more than the ring anyway (if you don't take the stroke into account anyway cause if I count that the ring is the absolute worst lol).
12409,"The ring was one of the only methods that didn't give me crazy bleeding though, second only to Slynd."
12410,The same thing happened to me.
12411,"It finally stopped at 1.5 years and now I dont get any bleeding at all, fingers crossed that happens for you!"
12412,that was exactly what happened to me when I got the kyleena!!
12413,because of that  other side effects I got it out after 8 months lol
12414,"Almost everyone I know with the IUD had spotting the first 3 months and then sometimes periods, then they stopped."
12415,"I had some very light spotting on the Implant when I combined it with the pill, but less than a month, and haven't had bleeding ever since."
12416,"Plus, I prefer a torture device in my arm over a torture device in my vagina."
12417,"I love my implant and I don't have to check if it is in its place still, it works correctly anyways"
12418,I've had mine since 2019 and I've always bled like that.
12419,I can't wait to get it out next year
12420,Did not know this was a thing!!
12421,Ive got mine inserted a month ago and I wont stop bleeding.
12422,"Wow, if it doesnt stop Im removing it"
12423,I had mine removed at 8 months for same reason.. i was bleeding almost constantly.
12424,I think i got one 8 wk break then back to spotting or full on period bleeding.
12425,"Insertion was horrendous, i had to return so she could get another midwife to help hold my cervix in position and that was after one labour to full dilation and C section and one VBAC."
12426,"Not something i would encourage before they have children, unless medication used to open cervix a little before hand."
12427,"At the time Essure was an option.. ha ha ha, so I had that done, and then surgically removed with a hysterectomy after a few years of symptoms because one was outside my uterus and had caused major adhesions.My daughters are now 16 and 18, and i would recommend neither to them sadly."
12428,"I lived through too many side effects over the years, but ultimately it will their decision.. one is vehemently opposed to the combined pill right now, but 18 and not ready for  sexual activity yet."
12429,"Ironically, I got the hormonal iud to treat that exact issue, which I had for over a year before getting the iud."
12430,It worked I havent bled hardly at all since getting it in!
12431,But I feel youthe reverse period cycle sucked
12432,Same.
12433,Im on my 4th one and I had it placed in March and its just constant light bleeding.
12434,Think Im just gonna take it out and go back to FAM.
12435,This was my exact experience with the implant hormones and bodies are strange!
12436,This is what lots of people experience on the implant.
12437,Both are progesterone methods so some people are just gonna react that way to it.
12438,Can confirm about the implant spotting.
12439,Ive had since April of 22 and Im getting it removed tomorrow.
12440,Constant random bleeding.
12441,"I spotted constantly with my Mirena for like the first 36 months, then spotted monthly for my period for two years, then my period stopped and now I finally get to enjoy having a Mirena"
12442,"I got my Mirena out, had horrible periods for 5 years, got another one and the insertion was even worse than the first because now my uterus is tilted and the dr thought it best to effing ADJUST IT WITH WHAT FELT LIKE HER FRIGGIN ARM DURING INSERTION!!"
12443,"Well I only suffered the second time in hopes of stopping the periods but no, lucky me, I got traumatized with this insertion and I still have horribly painful periods!!"
12444,"Theyre lighter, but the cramping and breast soreness is unreal."
12445,Ive had kyleena iud for 4.5 years now.
12446,Getting a second one in December when this one expires.
12447,I havent had a period since 2018 and no pregnancies!
12448,Best birth control ever.
12449,Insertion was like a really intense cramp for about 2 minutes but worth it for years of peace of mind.
12450,I was on the pill before this and worried constantly for years about taking it at the same time every day.
12451,My favorite story to tell is that I went to the beach about 3 hours after insertion and a party like 8 hours after that.
12452,"The doctor was very kind, walked me through it  while the pain got really bad and I raised my voice like WHOA, plus there was a little cramping like an hour later, it was overall a good experience."
12453,Im due for my replacement after six years in January and Ive had no pregnancy scares thus far!
12454,"I'm on my second Mirena, and it's fantastic."
12455,I didn't even take Tylenol or Advil before having them inserted.
12456,"It hurt a bit for like 30 seconds (the sound  which is the tool they use to measure the length of your uterus  was by far the worst part IMO), and I had some mild cramping for a few hours after, but it was nothing compared to my usual menstrual cramps."
12457,"Removal was barely noticeable pain wise, and I did have some sporadic bleeding for a bit with my first IUD, but there wasn't any with my second.Honestly, even if it had been painful to have inserted, it would still be worth it for me."
12458,"Before my IUD I literally had to wear an overnight pad, liner, and sometimes a tampon too, and would still bleed through, and I would often have bleeding every 2 weeks."
12459,It was a nightmare.
12460,"With my IUD, I've had 3 periods total in 2023, they've all lasted 12 days tops, and the bleeding is barely even enough to be considered spotting."
12461,"Cramps used to be debilitating and now they're still there, but I get bad cramping maybe every third or fourth cycle and it's much more manageable."
12462,A great insertion is basically a more annoying pap smear.
12463,Many have more painful period cramps than it.
12464,"I have a detailed story on it, and just need to update with my second IUD."
12465,For me it was basically a nonevent all three times (with a different person doing the insertion every time) The insertion was definitely painful... but the worst of it only lasted about a minute  mild/moderate cramping for the next day or so.
12466,"I always took the whole day off, but I could have gone back to school/work/whatever if I'd had to."
12467,No problems post insertion removal felt weird but didn't hurt.No part of the experience was something I'd normally tell anyone about because there's nothing TO tell
12468,"I can only speak for myself, but my insertion was exactly how my doctor explained it would be, like Im having a big cramp because she was placing something in my uterus."
12469,I did prep by taking Motrin before coming in.
12470,I also did not go into my visit with the expectation of having a 100 pain free experience.
12471,"She talked me through the whole thing, which always helps because obviously Im blind to whats happening down there."
12472,We have always had a great relationship (shes been my GYN for 15 years now) so Im super comfortable and she makes every exam comfortable.
12473,"I put off getting mine because i was so scared from all the bad stories, but in the end i did it and its the best thing i ever did for my health."
12474,Ive had two now with only ibuprofen beforehand.
12475,Yes its painful but for me it was like 10 seconds of intense cramping that i could breath through and then some light cramping for the rest of the day.
12476,I went to the gym after even!
12477,Now i havent had a period since and have never had to worry about pregnancy.
12478,"So, while my placement story isnt great (OB/GYN made me cry) the actual insertion wasnt too painful."
12479,"Once my body got used to the IUD, its been great!"
12480,"Im forgetful af sometimes, so having a BC that has littletono possibilities of user error is fantastic."
12481,"It was definitely one of the best decisions Ive made, and when my current one expires Ill likely get another one after I have some babies!"
12482,I had incredibly bad periods.
12483,"Like flow so heavy I needed to change pads every hour, pain that put me in bed along with the bowel/nausea fun."
12484,I was out for a week each month with the period and then spent another week recoveringNow with a mirena I havent even needed pads.
12485,I use pantyliners.
12486,I get about one day of mild pain that doesnt even need medication.
12487,Im myself for all of the time and its great.
12488,I was terrified of getting an IUD.
12489,"Put it off for years, put up with heavy bleeding, horrendous PMS, cramps etc."
12490,"I was so worried everything would be worse, particularly my mental health."
12491,I also have trauma around insertion.
12492,I finally took the plunge when I found out I could get it put in under a twilight anaesthetic.
12493,"I had to push for this, many a Dr said I didnt need it, but the nurses who put it in said it was a very difficult insertion so Im glad I persevered."
12494,At first it freaked me out knowing it was in there.
12495,I even had an ultrasound at about 6 weeks because I was convinced things had gone bad.
12496,Everything was fine and knowing that helped.
12497,Its now been a year and I consider it one of the best thing Ive done.
12498,"No bleeding, no pain, stable mood."
12499,Wish Id done it years ago!
12500,!
12501,My iud stopped my irregular bleeding and now I dont have periods at all!
12502,Its been great
12503,Mine expires next year and I will 100 be getting a new one put in.
12504,I absolutely love mine.
12505,"I have Kyleena and while insertion did hurt, my doctor was fantastic about everything and I went home and just slept it off."
12506,It took a few months for my body to get acclimated to it but its been great since it settled in.
12507,"I dont bleed anymore, my skin cleared up, Im honestly convinced it helped my mental health, and no pregnancy."
12508,I still get what I call a phantom period where Ill go through the entire cycle of mood swings and cramps but its very mild and I dont bleed so Ill take it.
12509,Ive had Kyleena for a year.
12510,Insertion was a tiny bit painful for about 5 seconds where I did in fact say oh fuck out loud .
12511,"I had cramps that evening, but was good to go the next day."
12512,"My periods were a little heavy for 34 months, but have been less and less as time goes on."
12513,This month (my 12th month having it) I had a little cramping and then one day of light bleeding and then nothing else.
12514,Hopefully it continues that way!
12515,A very positive experience.
12516,I am on my second mirena!
12517,"Insertion sucks as usual, but otherwise minimal recovery of a couple days of cramps and no periods."
12518,Been smooth sailing.
12519,"During my first one the strings were a bit long and some hair got tangled in it so that caused some pH issues, but otherwise everything has been rad and emotionally stable!"
12520,"It's not for everyone, but if it works out it works out."
12521,Honestly my insertion was entirely unremarkable lmao.
12522,The only funny thing that happened was the lady had to get longer clamps.
12523,"Apparently I was 'very tall' down there.A moment of intense cramping, and then I was done."
12524,"There WAS a moment like a week later where I was cramping REALLY hard, but it passed and I've been rather peaceful ever since."
12525,I plan on getting mine redone again in 2025.
12526,Ive had the jaydess for the last 3 years and a bit and actually just got a new one in July!
12527,Im so happy with it  seriously no issues at all.
12528,While insertation wasnt the most enjoyable it was bearable (im a tough nut with pain though so idk).
12529,For some reason the insertation of the replacement hurt more but its all forgotten now.When I first got it 3 years ago I had some minor bleeding/spotting for the first month but it eventually stopped.
12530,"Also only had my period maybe 5 times since I originally got the iud and havent had one in 1,5 years."
12531,"All in all 10/10  perfect bc for me personally.ETA my mom has had one for 23 years (4x Mirena, 1x jaydess) and she is absolutely happy with it too and has no issues at all."
12532,Shes the reason I was like ok ill try it
12533,Hi!My first IUD was my worst.
12534,"But even so, it was one really INTENSE cramp and then it was over."
12535,"It was like as soon as I was like yikes that hurts, the doctor was like okay were done!"
12536,And then I went home and slept for 4 hours and then went out to play trivia with my friends like any normal Wednesday.
12537,I just had my 4th one put in this past March after giving birth in January and my anxiety over it was worse than the actual IUD lol.
12538,"I barely felt it, it truly was a like period cramp."
12539,"I was a little more sore afterward than the previous 3 times, but nothing crazy."
12540,"Totally fine the next day.ETA  I did NOT get pregnant while having an IUD, just wanted to make that clear lol."
12541,I had it removed to have a baby.
12542,I really like my coil!
12543,People talk about the insertion pain but for me it was totally manageable  felt like a really intense smear with some cramping afterwards.
12544,"I used to have debilitating periods and while I still have them on the mirena, they are sooo much lighter and less painful."
12545,"Its been incredibly effective for me, I like that I never have to think about it, and I get 0 hormonal symptoms/side effects."
12546,I dont think Id ever switch to another form of contraception now.
12547,I'm on my second mirena IUD.
12548,"Ngl, my first insertion was painful, but it was practically nothing compared to period pains I used to get."
12549,The second insertion was much smoother.
12550,"I rarely get periods, and when I do, it's just mild spotting."
12551,I can't see myself going off of my IUD.
12552,I have Skyla andk
12553,I have a nonhorror complicated story that isnt a simple procedure either.
12554,Ive had an IUD (Kyleena) since 2019.
12555,"Getting it in, my doctor prescribed me some anxiety medication because of my medical history/trauma etc etc."
12556,"Before I could get it in it kinda wore off (wait times be like that where I live), but the doctor was so sweet and kind."
12557,"We attempted to put it in with my GP at the university clinic, but my pelvic floor issues makes me clench up yk?"
12558,So I was too small for them to get it in.
12559,"It wasnt the best, but it wasnt bad either."
12560,"I got scheduled for a gyno and they got it in no problem.I got my second one in June from a male gyno, and I was extremely worried about that."
12561,"His reviews were a bit iffy, but he was so kind and distracted me the whole time."
12562,I was able to bring someone (my partner) with me for both times and that helped ease a lot of the anxiety.
12563,"My only side effects were increased urination for a few weeks, mild cramping for 23 days, and my periods are once a month but sometimes I free bleed because theyre so light."
12564,Ive had my Mirena for just over 5 years now and I could not be happier.
12565,Insertion had a painful moment but nothing that lasted longer than a minute.
12566,"I drove myself home, used a heating pad, and was back at work the next day."
12567,I havent had any issues with it aside from an occasional cramp around when my period normally would be.
12568,I plan to get another inserted after the end of this ones life!
12569,"Here's my wife's experience with IUDs, the good and the bad She got the copper Paragard first."
12570,Painful insertion.
12571,"Essentially the whole time she had it, she'd have random episodes of cramps that were pretty bad, although they weren't happening 100 of the time."
12572,"One day she noticed he strings were longer than normal, so she got it checked out."
12573,"The Paragard had shifted out of place, and that was enough for her to decide to get it removed."
12574,"She went to Nuvaring next, when she really loved."
12575,"But those with migraine history are more likely to suffer a stroke on Nuvaring, so her gyno switched her off of it."
12576,"She decided to go back to an IUD, this time Kyleena."
12577,No cramps or problems with it so far!
12578,She's had it for a few years.
12579,No cramping like with the Paragard.
12580,"She still has light periods on it, but it is effective at its main task."
12581,I had a mirena placed in January 2019 and I didnt even feel the insertion.
12582,It was completely painless.
12583,I stopped having periods and I had no side effects the entire time.
12584,Husband and I had sex regularly for five years with no pregnancy scares.
12585,I got it removed in April of this year so we could have another baby and I barely felt removal just a tiny pinch.
12586,"A month later, I was pregnant (as planned)."
12587,I will DEFINITELY get another mirena after this baby.
12588,Its my absolute favorite birth control.
12589,I have a Mirena.
12590,"First 6 weeks spotting, then 1,5 year no period, 3 years very light and last months it has been too light to notice apart from some light cramps."
12591,Have had it for almost 5 years and no real complaints apart from a cramp sometimes (but that could just as well happen with my normal heavy flow periods) and that it can hurt sometimes to have a bit more rough intercourse.
12592,But I'll definitely get another one if I need to!
12593,I resisted it for so long because I liked having something I could start and stop on my own.
12594,"Abortion ruling in the US changed that for me, so I got an IUD.I used to have such heavy periods Ive been sent to the ER for anemia."
12595,"Every period was 8 days of misery, changing a tampon every 2 hours or bleeding through."
12596,I would just sit on the floor of the shower and cry by the 8th day lol.
12597,"Id tried everything, medication, every birth control pill, patch, or ring."
12598,Every ultrasound and image turns up fine.
12599,"Ive been this way since my first period at 13.Ive been on the IUD for a year now, and about once a month I have a period that lasts less than 8 hours."
12600,"I dont even wear tampons or pads, I just need a pantyliner."
12601,"I came to my husband an utter tearful mess (terrified the poor guy) after the fourth one, just completely sobbing some nonsense about how I used the bathroom and it wasnt a war zone."
12602,Its life changing though!
12603,"Add to that that I feel more myself than I have since I was a teenager, as the hormones are local and I was used to oral (systemic) methods."
12604,My libido is back to how it was when I was 18.
12605,Insertion was painful but I just cursed my way through it.
12606,I check the strings daily so I know they dont move.
12607,"My husbands never felt them during the deed, which I was initially worried about as the ends of the cord feel a bit sharp."
12608,I've had iud for 6 years now.
12609,"Getting it put in was painful, but I was fresh off of giving birth so I didn't care."
12610,I have not had a period since.
12611,"Occasionally I have very light spotting (not even a tampon worth) or mild cramping, but otherwise totally period free."
12612,I guess the only downside to that is anytime I have a random ghost flutter or fast weight gain I instantly think I'm pregnant  but so far no fetus just ghosts.
12613,I initially chose iud because it's what my obgyn recommended.
12614,She had just had a baby.
12615,"I asked her about the horror stories and she explained that people only talk about an issue ,not the positive."
12616,And that it was just as likely to not work out as any other form of bc.
12617,"She told me she had been using it her entire adult life and when her and her husband decided to have a baby, she got her iud removed and was pregnant in less than a year."
12618,"I was only 21 when I had my first child, so I wanted good birth control but also something easy to remove if I wanted more later on."
12619,Ive had a Kyleena for since the February 2020 and no period since April 2020.
12620,"Zero babies, and to put things lightly, the iud is the only form of birth control my partner and I use lol."
12621,"I think I might want kids by the time it has to come out, but if I dont I think Ill get another one."
12622,I love my mirena.
12623,Its due to be replaced but Ive had it since 2018 and havent been pregnant that whole time  it was a wee bitch to have put in but was fine after with some codeine for the cramps and since then have essentially not had a period in five years.
12624,I had Mirena inserted a couple weeks ago and I was terrified going into it.
12625,"While the insertion was extremely painful for me and the cramping pretty bad for a few days after, since then its been smooth sailing."
12626,Spotting was obsolete after a few days.
12627,I would do it again (hope that helps a little)
12628,"I got my first copper iud in 2015, it was amazing for me."
12629,Insertion wasnt fun but wasnt excruciating because they numbed me with the needle first.
12630,The entire procedure took less than 5 min.
12631,My periods were definitely heavier but after the first couple months I didnt have an issue with spotting anymore.
12632,It treated me well for 7 years and then I got my second one.
12633,"Removal was fine, again she numbed me and I barely felt her take it out."
12634,It was uncomfortable but bearable when she put the second one in.
12635,"However, it took my body a year to adjust to the second one and it was terrible."
12636,Like spotting for a straight year which caused BV and yeast infections too.
12637,It was really frustrating.
12638,"But I held out because I dont want to go on hormonal birth control again, and now its been completely fine."
12639,"I got my first copper coil about a month after turning 18, im about to be 33 and I just got my 5th one fitted last month."
12640,I get mini ones so they only last 5 years (and I had 2 removed early because of other health issues).
12641,"I wouldnt have any other BC, the insertion is painful for less than a minute, for me removing the old one is more painful than getting the new one put in.For the latest one I spent longer chatting to the dr than the actual procedure, I was out in maybe 20mins all included, took pain killers as soon as I left and spent the rest of the afternoon carrying boxes and heavy things about."
12642,I didnt have a single cramp or anything.
12643,"I dont have artificial hormones messing up my brain (when I was on the pill I had to take anti depressants at the same time because it made my mental health so bad), my periods are clockwork, they last 4 days with 2 days of heavy bleeding (i need to empty my cup three times during the day) and I dont need to worry about missing pills or interactions with the other meds I take."
12644,"Im never looking back, Ill be team copper coil until my menopause.Edit I have a mona lisa NT cu380 mini (if that matters)"
12645,"Im mostly going off the measurements/amounts/info my obgyn told me during my most recent consult and the research Ive seen onlineit does seem that the mainstream hormonal IUDs result in less hormones in the bloodstream overall than the implant does, but Im not sure how large the difference in amount would have to be for there to be any difference in side effects (for a normal person who wasnt super sensitive to hormones at least.)"
12646,"And no it definitely isnt 100 localized of course, but the way the hormonal IUDs can get away with having less hormones to begin with is because theyre so centralized to the uterus itself."
12647,Sorry if my wording was a bit off!
12648,"If youre particularly sensitive to hormones like I am even the smallest amount could make a difference, and the hormonal IUD is about as low as you can get before going copper."
12649,"Again though I havent tried out every type of contraceptive (like Ive never had the implant myself) so I dunno if the difference in hormone levels would be enough to make a huge difference in side effects for most people, my case may be a rarer one since I just cant stand hormones at all."
12650,Expulsion is definitely a concern but the rates arent crazy high so I felt it was worth it personally but many people definitely prefer to avoid it!
12651,Honestly before getting it I expected expulsion rates to be way higher than they actually are because of all the awful stories Id heard about it.
12652,"I think Id feel similarly concerned about the possibility of the implant migrating which happens sometimes as well, so I decided I might as well go the nonhormonal route since at least I wouldnt have the bazillion other awful side effects on top of it all lol!"
12653,"One of my friends has had a great experience with hers, she has no side effects and only a period every 4 months or so."
12654,"Shes the only one close to me who has had a good experience, but ive seen plenty on here with good experiences as well."
12655,It sucks having to try different things until you find whats right.
12656,It took me 3 years to find out the IUD was best for me.
12657,This.
12658,Aside from the monthish of bleeding after I got my first one put it I have had zero problems with it.
12659,I know people react differently but thats my reason for going through the insertion pain two times now.
12660,I think I have Mirena too did your bleeding decrease or go away completely?
12661,I think this is the first month my period doesnt come and Im a little worried
12662,Oh that sucks.
12663,I never lost hair but stopping depo didnt make me lose weight.
12664,I had weight loss as a side effect later from another med so didnt wanna risk it again.
12665,No cravings.
12666,I ate salads and drank water.
12667,I worked out and nothing helped.
12668,I second this.
12669,I would fly for a treatment like this.
12670,"It was at a Kaiser clinic in Portland, OR!"
12671,Their interstate east office.
12672,"It wasnt expensive for me because my health insurance covers birth control, but my insurance is also Kaiser bc its an HMO."
12673,Meaning the only in network stuff is through their own clinics.
12674,The doctor told me that this was the standard treatment at the clinic and that all the providers do it this way.
12675,"She said theyre working on getting in house anesthesia, like doing it in the OBGYN office, but when I got it done, if I wanted to get put under I would have to go to the general surgery area, and would have had to schedule out a year!"
12676,(I guess theyre still catching up on surgeries from COVID.)
12677,Probably not.
12678,"I've seen plenty of stories where it went smoothly, and when it isn't it's usually because the procedure isn't done correctly."
12679,My sister's insertion was botched and I was so mad at the clinic.
12680,"Okay, but they do have to cut you open to remove it right?"
12681,I will agree with IUD insertion/removal being barbaric because its true.
12682,"Migration from the implantation site to other places in the body and getting lost, one person had it somehow migrate close to their heart or in it."
12683,IUDs can migrate too but its pretty much gonna stay in your uterus/tubes or just fall out.
12684,Ive read about patients having the implant migrate to their lungs.
12685,It was lifethreatening.
12686,I actually had it the full 5 years and it was wonderful.
12687,Periodic spotting for 23 months and then I never had a full period again.
12688,"Occasionally I would get some cramps but no worse than before I got it and nothing that couldn't be fixed with Pamprin (I prefer it over Midol) and a heating pad.Some tips I've learned from getting 2 IUDs is start taking magnesium at night a few days before your appointment, and then take some the morning of your appointment."
12689,"It helps with feeling calm, relieving any nerves, and it relaxes your muscles."
12690,Also take some ibuprofen an hour or so before.
12691,The first time all I had was ibuprofen but the second time I included the magnesium and it made a significant difference.
12692,"My provider's office also gave us the option to pay 75 for laughing gas starting from about 5 minutes before we started until it was over, I still felt a little discomfort but it was so quick and I was much more relaxed.Have a heating pad available when you get home and don't make any plans that night."
12693,I didn't have any lasting pain but I definitely also didn't want to do anything lol.
12694,Just get some takeout and chill.
12695,Good luck with your appointment!
12696,Maybe it's state differences?
12697,I'm in WV.
12698,I mean pregnancy is always a possibility because nothing is 100  but the baby wont come out like a gladiator holding the defeated IUD between its fingers.
12699,Its just different for everyone.
12700,I took ibuprofen the first time and felt nothing.
12701,"This second time I got mine, I decided not to take anything to see of there was a difference."
12702,I still felt nothing.
12703,I have kids though so that could be a factor as well.
12704,I have heard from other people theyre insertion was very easy too.
12705,I do not think its a matter of pain tolerance and more based on anatomy
12706,Pretty good!
12707,I had bad cramping before my periods for the first few months but theyre gone now and I feel like theres a chance it may have effected my skin but other than that its been fine! )
12708,I've been breaking out like crazy.
12709,I'd attributed it to stress but that might be another explanation.
12710,It is not only me with more visible pores!
12711,"I also get slight hormonal acne (less than in my pillfree week), somehow following my natural cycle, but my skin isn't that bad."
12712,"No bleeding here, but it is a common side effect"
12713,"I mean the copper coil, I forgot to mention."
12714,But yeah anything hormonal amplifies your chances of those things
12715,"God I hope, its been nearly a year and a half though"
12716,I've just decided to live with it.
12717,Before it I would bleed so heavy it would soak a pad in 30 mins sometimes so I lose either way lmao
12718,"Glad that works for them, when I had an IUD I bled every day almost for 78 months straight along with a very traumatic insert."
12719,Goes to show just how different hormones affect everyone.
12720,"I swapped to the implant, and though my periods come more frequently like an actual cycle now, much happier with it."
12721,A main reason I got the IUD is that there is less hormones and its more localized.
12722,I'm not a fan of birth control at all but hate condoms so IUD it is for me.
12723,I had irregular periods for a few months after mirena insertion but a year in my periods are very short and light
12724,Omg im sorry to hear it went so horribly for you!
12725,The only issue I've had for the year and half is the bleeding (and accompanied BV from my PH being thrown off by bleeding so much but boric acid takes care of that in a night) Before I had the IUD I would have insanely heavy periods.
12726,"Im talking Soak a pad in 30 mins, big clots, horrible cramping, so I've settled for the trade off of longer but lighter."
12727,I also hate hormonal BC in general but the copper IUD would not help my issue so I settled for the hormonal IUD since it's less hormones and localized.
12728,"After removing nexplanon after cravings/weight gain, Im getting kyleena in 2 days and theyre giving me laughing gas during it, plus getting a pap again for the first time in 2 years."
12729,"My boyfriend is in charge of transporting me home, lol!"
12730,Thanks for this positive story as I was worried about kyleena.
12731,I had wanted paragard since its totally non hormonal but both my primary and OBGYN told me I really should not get it.
12732,Im getting the Kyleena soon and Im very hopeful) thanks for sharing your positive experience
12733,"My Kyleena caused me horrible pain for a couple days after insertion, but I think it was still worth it."
12734,"My cramps are now manageable without having to constantly take ibuprofen now and except for on the first day, I dont have to constantly change my tampon/pad during the day."
12735,"Not to mention its really helped give me the peace of mind in regards to birth control, and that has made it easier for me to get over the anxiety I used to have about sex in general due to trauma."
12736,My bday party is the 16th and Im getting kyleena in on the 15th
12737,This is so good to hear!
12738,Im switching to Kyleena soon from the pill and cant wait
12739,Thank you!!
12740,I completely agree with you.
12741,So dang tired of misinformation on IUDs here.
12742,I feel like the implant migrating is more comparable to the IUD migrating in your body  both very rare but serious complications that need immediate care.
12743,"Expulsion of an IUD while not common, isn't all that rare either but I can't really think of an equivalent for the implant."
12744,Don't get me wrong  IUDs are extremely effective but if it expels that's not part of the efficacy rate because it's not actually there anymore.
12745,And I've seen expulsion rates anywhere from 2 to 10  wish there was a better stat without so much variance cause 10 is a much bigger deal to me than 2.
12746,"I absolutely agree how much it sucks to have to try different things out to find out what works for you, and until you do your body goes through so much shit."
12747,"If my birth control was purely for not getting pregnant, my bf is more than happy to get a vasectomy."
12748,"But sadly, I have hormonal imbalance and shit was really crazy before I got my implant."
12749,My bleeding stopped completely with Mirena.
12750,I love it!
12751,Nothing to worry about
12752,"Initially it decreased (thank God), and still used a menstrual cup."
12753,I had some cyst issues so that threw things off for a while.
12754,It really started decreasing flow and skipping pretty quickly.
12755,"But by year three I get a period, but it's really just light spotting for a day or two."
12756,I skip periods in random waves.
12757,"You have to get used to skipping periods, I initially bought a bunch of dollar store pregnancy tests when mine started skipping  all good five and a half years in!"
12758,Nah thats scary Im getting off this shit..
12759,Yep.
12760,Yeah its a 1/4 inch incision thats painless.
12761,"This method of BC wasnt a match for me, but the insertion and removal was very simple"
12762,"Insertion is basically an oversized needle puncture, for removal they do use a scalpel but it still is tiny and no stitches necessary."
12763,Typically removal is in the same area your insertion was so as to not create a new mark either.
12764,"You'd never notice my scar unless I pointed it out, I got Nexplanon removed last year."
12765,Thanks so much for the advice ) I love taking magnesium normally as a calming supplement before bed so this is perfect.
12766,All super helpful tips.
12767,Have a great day!
12768,"I get that, I know some people have mentioned use of anesthesia and I remember one gynecologist said that wouldnt be necessary because if it were to be used theyd have to use the same needle used for epidurals, so that definitely would be a bit much for a short process."
12769,Im taking combination pills right now but eventually I do want to look into other options.
12770,Hearing this makes it sound less scary.
12771,Thats great it sounds like overall ) thanks for sharing!Im getting it soon so its encouraging to hear
12772,It could be!
12773,I get little pimples here and there.
12774,"Once, a planet on my nose bridge lol."
12775,Do you do skincare?
12776,Has it helped your skin despite having an implant?
12777,ah man thats no fun im sorry / i had pretty regular periods before/after BC so keeping what was causing it didnt make sense for me
12778,"The implant also has a lower dose, although it is less localised."
12779,Opted for that one because I don't want to put a lot of hormones in my body anymore.
12780,"I don't mind condoms, but I use BC not even as birth control, but to control my periods."
12781,I was about to get an IUD but my I was scared of the metal thing (speculum?)
12782,"and the insertion, plus my doctor said that I was required to take a full uninsured STD test panel first."
12783,"Nvm, implant it is"
12784,The laughing gas is awesome!
12785,"I wish that was offered at my doctors office, they told me there is nothing they can do for pain management because all the pain is due to the uterus contracting and there is nothing they can do to numb an entire organ ( but I'd love anything other than being stone cold sober and awake lol."
12786,"x200BBest of luck, I truly hope you have as great of a Kyleena experience as I have."
12787,"From what I understand copper IUDs really do make bleeding worse, which is miserable for anyone."
12788,did they offer an explanation about why not paragard?
12789,(i have paragard)
12790,Im getting Kyleena soon too ) let us know if youre enjoying it!
12791,My OB also encouraged me not to get Paragard
12792,"If your party goes reeeeal good make sure you use a second form of contraception (IMPORTANT) for 12 weeks after you get your IUD in, unless youve already had one or were on another BC."
12793,I waited the whole week anyway because of paranoia This is mostly to protect from infection since youll be prone to that until it settles.
12794,"Please, I wish there was more info on the expulsion rates because mine is currently expelling (idk its in my cervix lmao) and its been a little over a year with my Kyleena."
12795,Though Im about to get another one to replace it
12796,Thank you so much for that!
12797,"Ive bought my fair share already but I can breathe a little easier now that Ive seen its a common trend, thank you )"
12798,That is good to know thank you.
12799,Thats true.
12800,Im not needle phobic but Im a step away from that so I think this is also why Im more partial to the IUD even with its harsh insertion/removal method.
12801,My personal opinion even if insertion hurt it would be worth it.
12802,"I wouldnt even want to deal with epidural, numbing or any of that."
12803,The world of birth control is so crazy to me.
12804,"Theres so many forms, you never know what will work out for you."
12805,If the combo pill is working with no side effects I wouldnt mess with a good thing.
12806,Ive gone through so many before (thankfully) finding this one.
12807,Not consistently.
12808,"I'm super busy and disabled, so I'll do it for a few days and then miss for a few."
12809,"When I do, it's a barebones routine  cleanser, benzoyl peroxide spot treatment, moisturizer.The lack of routine is definitely not what's causing the issue though."
12810,"I've never been able to keep a consistent routine, I've been using the same products for months or years, and my skin is much more oily and the breakouts are more common than before the implant."
12811,"I don't care that much though lol, I'll happily trade a few zits for almost nonexistent periods and completely nonexistent uterine invaders."
12812,"Fair lmao, I went to planned parenthood and everything was insured for me there."
12813,I think I had to pay a 5 dollar copay.
12814,Oddly I had never even had a gyno exam but the IUD seemed less scary to me than in implant.
12815,insertion was hell though.
12816,They lied to you about not being able to do anything for pain.
12817,The Dr's can do shots inside of you similar to shots you get at the dentist.
12818,Most Dr's I've asked don't do numbing because they find that people complain about the shots hurting and or hurting worse than insertion.
12819,After numbing you have to wait 10 to 15 minutes prior to the procedure.
12820,I've had 3 iuds and only 1 done with numbing by a Midwife and gyno specialist.
12821,I have a tilted uterus so the insertions have been incredibly painful.
12822,The numbing one was definitely worth it.
12823,Hope you find a Dr who will provide pain reduction option for you if you get another.
12824,Thank u!
12825,And yeah sometimes I wonder if cis men needed IUDs that we would already have better solutions
12826,"When I was consulting doctors for my copper IUD, I was told multiple times that if your usual periods are heavy and painful, you're not a great candidate as copper IUDs are known for exacerbating those even further."
12827,"Personally, haven't noticed much difference between the periods I had way back when before getting on the pill and how they are with my copper IUD (nothing crazy but definitely heavier than on the pill though!)"
12828,and cramps do not bother me.
12829,What ggrosebee said!
12830,My period is heavy for the first couple days and my cramps suck but typically go away with 2 aleve.
12831,So yeah they scared me off that.
12832,"Im not strong enough for the long haul, probably."
12833,My doctor strongly advised against it.
12834,She said shes seen too many complications from the copper iud.
12835,"It sounds good on paper but Im surprised how discouraged it is, the paragard I mean"
12836,Ohhh!
12837,Damn it I told my bf that was one of my birthday wishes!!
12838,Haha I was gonna ask the doctor regardless but thank u for the info!
12839,"I wish I had better info, IUDs are one of the only methods left to me if I ever stop Slynd and that info would make me feel so much better."
12840,"I do know having one expel does tend to mean you are more likely to have another expel, but it is by no means assured and I don't have the stats to go with that statement unfortunately."
12841,Many people have a replacement and no further issues  I hope you fall into that camp and wish you the best with your replacement.
12842,I took one recently again after having a four month pause with no spotting.
12843,you get used to it.
12844,It's really helped my iron.
12845,"I look back to being floored by first day cramps and bleeding through my clothes and am like ""how did I not know that I should do something about that?"""
12846,Which is totally valid!
12847,Even regular pelvic exams are painful for me so I'm basically the opposite of you with the standard IUD insertion process pretty much being off the table.
12848,"But my doctor will do anesthesia for me if I do ever try the IUD, I am so glad he is understanding of my pain and associated anxiety."
12849,Thats very valid.
12850,Im considering other options as Im not the best at taking pills on time although Ive gotten better about it recently.
12851,I initially wanted to use a birth control ring like annovera or Nuvaring but annovera isnt covered by my insurance and nuvaring had a high copay so I decided to try pills and I just stuck with it for the past few years
12852,"Yeah, I expected it to be insured as well."
12853,"I think STD tests are important, because they can be risky for IUD insertions, but I don't have 100 just laying around as a student... insertion of the implant wasn't even that bad, only cried because there was a needle in my arm."
12854,"No numbing, opted for the no numbing option volunteerinngly."
12855,"I hate needles, so the less needles, the better haha."
12856,"The only big downside is that I can feel the implant, and yeah you don't have that problem with an IUD!Both have advantages and disadvantages, but they are both great low hormonal options that might control periods"
12857,"Wow, freaky to think about a needle up there so Im sure thats why they dont mention it much."
12858,Makes me pale just thinking about it tbh
12859,Same!
12860,I have PCOS and I got LOADS of hassle about getting a copper.
12861,I had to talk doctor into letting me.
12862,Its been great!
12863,Yes bleeding was heavier and cramps were worse for like 9 months but then it went back to normal (normal being pretty bad for me anyway ).
12864,"Love my copper!I think it's people who go to it from hormonal birth control that have the most trouble as they aren't used to ""proper"" periods I.e."
12865,are generally lighter than average.
12866,So when it's heavier they get a shock!
12867,Thank you so much!!
12868,Really hoping this doesnt expel as I love IUDs but its so high maintenance for actual insertion and removal.
12869,Totally!
12870,"And Im not antiimplant for anyone, its just not my preference."
12871,I am so happy its an easy thing that works for a lot of people.
12872,The more variety of effective birth control methods we have available the better!
12873,Women are not a one size fits all.
12874,For me worth it because I get seizure reduction from using the birth control.
12875,I got more pale the 2 times I had no numbing but my uterus is very tilted so even paps are hard for Dr's to do.
12876,They swab with numbing first then give a few shots and have you wait.
12877,I've tried many other birth controls but haven't had great results with others.
12878,"Holy moly you are strong to endure that for 9 months, I think I would tap out of my periods were any stronger."
12879,Im really glad to hear that and glad its an option!
12880,Im scared just getting cavities fixed  thats awesome that youve found something that works.
12881,It was tough I won't lie.
12882,"All that got me through was some strong ibprofen, but I was determined as hormonal birth control isnt an option and I had had too many close calls."
12883,Then one month it was just better  it's been about a year since then and its great.
12884,Im glad I stayed the course.
12885,Thank you!
12886,Cavities hurt and the shots in the mouth are super bad lol.
12887,So happy for you!!
12888,!
12889,So idk if this is because of Depo or I might be infected with an STD???
12890,Idk.
12891,I do know one side effect of getting this demon shot is that now I cant lift my arms past a certain point without them trying to cramp on me.
12892,This has been like this for a few years now.
12893,"I only got the shot I believe 3 times (Ill check but if so, its 2 in my right arm and one on my left) and it was cool but now that Ive changed job positions and I do a little bit more heavy lifting, its like my right arm (the upper half) is aching a lot more lately."
12894,I cant sleep on my sides anymore because they ache sometimes.
12895,I thought that it was maybe just me exacerbating the pain from my wrist but I really think this shot has been deteriorating my body and Im kinda scared.
12896,I also think I might possibly have an STD because I used to date a man (who I broke up with in May) who I found out was gay and meeting up with people so yeah.
12897,Anybody else feel like their arms are deteriorating?

12911,Hi I'm afraid I don't know anything about your situation but I do have a question if you don't mine me asking ofcourse.
12912,I've had my IUD for two weeks and I want to check if everything is alright (I haven't yet because the cramps are so awful I couldn't bring myself to) but I'm really at a loss for how you're supposed to feel for the strings.
12913,Like I can barely get my finger in let alone get it all the way up to my cervix.
12914,I'm so sorry if this is intrusive but is there like a certain way you're supposed to put your finger(s) up because I really have no clue.
12915,Oh girl its okay!
12916,"So for me, and everyone is different with the IUD just like other Bc."
12917,I had some wild cramps for like the first 3 months.
12918,I get it!
12919,I find it easiest to either put a foot up on the side of the tub or a chair and stick one finger in there and it really feels like fishing wire honestly.
12920,Or laying in bed you can try too.
12921,But the tub or chair or something seems to be easiest.
12922,I will tell you I went to the drs twice just to make sure things were correct those first few months.
12923,Your first few weeks will be a struggle.
12924,Just remember if it gets worse to go to the drs asap
12925,Thank you so much for your reply you actually eased my mind a lot

12948,"Right now I'm on nexplanon but I feel like my temper is AWFUL and it's ruining my relationship with my boyfriend, I also feel like it's making me gain weight which I hate."
12949,"I hate getting periods because of the pain and hormones don't feel good, but I do want to be protected so I feel like the copper iud is my only option."
12950,I've heard awful stories about the insertion and how much it hurts and I'm terrified because of it.
12951,but I can't keep living like this.
12952,how are your periods with the copper iud?
12953,And is the pain worse?
12954,please tell me everything because I need to get this over with.
12955,I absolutely loved my copper IUD until I got pregnant with it in place.
12956,"Insertion was brutal but I had no side effects for over a year and it was like a dream, until it turned into a nightmare."
12957,Everyones experience is different.
12958,For me insertion was a breeze I barely felt a thing.
12959,"Was intimate 24 hours later, no pain."
12960,My period are fine and barely changed.
12961,I dont get cramps or pms.
12962,No side effects.
12963,Ive had unbearable side effects with every other (hormonal) form of bc Ive tried.
12964,This is my 2nd composer iud.
12965,I took my first one out myself.
12966,Only issue is I do believe it was partially expelling itself because I could feel the plastic tip emerging from my cervix.
12967,So I just check my current one regularly
12968,My (30 f) first experience here and Im only on day 3.
12969,Got it on Tuesday of this week and today is Friday.
12970,Insertion sucked.
12971,Pain scale 9/10.
12972,I felt like I had to pee and clench at the same time.
12973,"I experienced more pressure than anything else, only one pinch and that was from the speculum."
12974,I didnt take anything before nor did I ask for any numbing agent.
12975,It took probably a real 5 minutes to get it in and the strings cut.
12976,Definitely needed a cigarette after that was over.
12977,Went right to work.
12978,"Had some pretty bad cramps, kinda what I would get on a bad day of my period so they were tolerable."
12979,Towards the end of the night my lower back was throbbing.
12980,By the time I woke up the next morning I was at least 90 in less pain.
12981,A cramp here and there.
12982,Todays Friday and I dont feel anything.
12983,Since Tuesday Ive had a super light bleed.
12984,Ive been wearing a pad and its super light and it really only comes when I wipe.
12985,Today its more on the brown side so im hoping that means its almost done.
12986,My period also ending Monday so Im due for another few weeks.
12987,No smell or pain so I think im okay.
12988,I go see the doctor in 2 months so they can check it out and make sure everything is still in place.
12989,I 100 agree that everyone's experience is different.
12990,"I nearly died because my doctors at the time completely ignored that my copper IUD was perforating my left tube, causing inflammation in my whole body."
12991,Wasn't fun.
12992,Upon the nth time at ER I finally got help.
12993,"The pain was insane, I couldn't move much of the time."
12994,My whole body was in pain from that tiny piece of plastic and metal.Others love the same thing.
12995,It totally depends on the person and how well the insertion is done.
12996,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.

13000,"I had a 10yr Copper IUD inserted 2 days ago, so I cant really help with long term effects, but Ill summarise my experience with insertion.My first attempt, I was given a student nurse."
13001,I was not offered any anaesthesia and I took no pain meds beforehand.
13002,"She messed up and my cervix closed up like Fort Knox, meaning the appointment had to be rescheduled."
13003,"It was admittedly the most painful experience of my life, but it was still manageable.The second attempt I was referred to a more experienced nurse."
13004,I took 2 paracetamol beforehand and asked for a numbing spray.
13005,"Insertion went smoothly, and it was slightly less painful."
13006,"The cramps afterwards were pretty bad so I took the day off.I wont lie, overall it was pretty excruciating, but I didnt cry/scream/vomit/faint like stories you see on the internet."
13007,"I think it varies from woman to woman, and it really depends on whether you think its worth it.Pro Tip Advocate for yourself!"
13008,ASK FOR ANAESTHETIC beforehand!!
13009,"If they refuse and you think youll need it, look for another clinic."
13010,Other I am under 18 and a virgin so my experience may have been worse.
13011,If you have had children Ive read that its a lot less painful.
13012,Bad at first but now good
13013,"Ive had mine for over a month now, love it."
13014,"Insertion wasnt super bad for me actually, just felt like a slightly sharper period cramp."
13015,"(Im a total super wimp too, for reference.)"
13016,"I took 800mg ibuprofen and some Xanax, they didnt numb me or offer any other pain relief, and it was okay!"
13017,Over very quickly.
13018,Mild cramps for the rest of the day that were solved super easily with a heating pad.
13019,I would recommend having someone drive you and taking off work/school that day though.
13020,"Had two periods since then and they are heavier but not more painful, and theyre actually shorter than before (I was bleeding 10 days on hormones."
13021,Down to 6 now.)
13022,"My sex drive is back, my mood is better, all the hormonal side effects I hated are gone."
13023,Just check your strings every so often and you should be fine!Edit I also think my cervix isnt super sensitive because I can barely pap smears at all.
13024,"If pap smears are very uncomfortable and/or painful for you, your experience may vary."
13025,I might just have a good obgyn though and thats why I barely feel paps who knows!
13026,All anecdotal lol.
13027,Ive never had any babies though so I was expecting it to be worse.
13028,let's hope I don't get pregnant.
13029,thank you for your answer!
13030,!
13031,Wow..
13032,Did they give you any numbing cream of something?
13033,and how do you check it?
13034,thank you!!
13035,that's really helpful!
13036,!
13037,God damn that is not good.
13038,are you okay now?
13039,?
13040,it still hurt with numbing??
13041,I'm terrified.
13042,thank you so much though!
13043,!
13044,"My first iud I took ibuprofen, This last one I didnt take anything."
13045,"To check it, you just reach on."
13046,"Depending on where youre at in your cycle, your cervix moves."
13047,Sometimes its closer and easier to feel just so you know.
13048,This is normal.
13049,I wrap my strings around my cervix
13050,I'm totally fine since.
13051,I attribute most of my issues to my doctors'  incompetence btw.
13052,"As long as you have a decent doc, it should all be fine."
13053,There are a few types of local anaesthetic you can get.
13054,"I had a spray, which helped a bit, but wasnt the most effective."
13055,"You can get a kind of lidocaine gel applied, or an injection."
13056,The injection especially is far more effective.
13057,I wrap my strings around my cervixI'm sorry this might sound dumb but what do you mean by this?ans can you still wear tampons the same?
13058,Yes you can wear tampons but no menstrual cups.
13059,So your cervix is like a little knob that sticks out with a small hole.
13060,"Before you give birth, it thins out and opens up so the baby can come through."
13061,"(Then it returns to normal).During insertion of an iud, they use a speculum to open up your cervix and insert the iud."
13062,"So afterwards, you should feel 2 strings hanging out (they are like fishing wire almost)."
13063,The strings are there so that they can remove the iud.
13064,"Instead of letting the string hang down towards the opening of your vagina (risk to poke your partner), you can swirl them around your cervix."
13065,This keeps them out of the way completely
13066,"ohh okay, that makes sense."
13067,did it hurt when they opened up the cervix?
13068,I'm sorry for asking so many questions!
13069,I'm just a bit scared
13070,Jumping on to say you should request they leave the strings long!!!
13071,They cut mine way shorter than I wanted but I didnt think to mention it beforehand.
13072,"You can always go back and get them cut shorter later if you want, but once theyre short its too late!"
13073,"My partner says they dont poke him or anything so its fine, but they feel a bit poky to me when I check my strings and Id prefer to be able to just swirl them around."
13074,"It didnt feel like anything, but I have kids so usually thats the case when it comes to getting and IUD."
13075,Have you had a Pap smear before?
13076,Its basically the same thing
13077,"I've never had anyone really looked at me like that, I have had sex but I'm pretty sure that's very different and non related."
13078,Ive been on the pill for coming up to 4 years now.
13079,Ive been thinking about it for a while and I think Ive decided to come off of it.
13080,I am having really bad anxiety over this decision though.
13081,The reason Ive decided to come off is because the doctor has prescribed me another brand (this will be my 3rd) and I dont really want to change so thought now would be the best time to stop.
13082,Im not sexually active so thats not why Im worrying.
13083,I went on the pill due to heavy and painful periods however being on the pill has made my mental health suffer and Ive experienced a number of other symptoms.
13084,Lots of people including my mum have told me not to come off the pill because I might start having sex.
13085,The thing is I havent yet and when that time does come I more than likely will get the implant as I dont wanna risk anything if I take my pill late or miss one.
13086,Im not really sure what this post is saying but I guess I just want some reassurance this if I come off of the pill nothing bad will happen.

13114,I recently tried it after seeing it in this sub a bunch and its as good as everyone says.
13115,I asked for a specific brand and they sent a years worth to my pharmacy of choice for 25.
13116,Extremely no muss no fuss.
13117,I take my pill at 9 pm.
13118,I usually start a pack on Wednesday.
13119,I picked it up Thursday.

13125,I would take it as soon as you pick it up and then again at your normal time.
13126,Thats something that is completely up to you.
13127,"Personally, I start on the day that I pick up the tablets."
13128,"The packs that I get usually come with stickers that have the days of the week on them, and you can stick them over the days printed on the pack so that it starts on the day you start it, if that makes sense?"
13129,"Take the pill at the usual time that you take it, this helps to keep you on your routine."
13130,"Its okay if you skip a day, but just make sure youre using another form of protection for a few days at least, just in case."
13131,"Personally, it would be easier for me to just start the pack on Thursday from now on."
13132,But thats completely up to you!
13133,"I havent ever messed this up so bad, but I accidentally forgot to start my new birth control pill pack on time."
13134,My period finished on Sunday and I always skip the last week of placebo pills during my period and I just forgot to start the new pack.
13135,Im a Sunday starter usually.
13136,I didnt begin a new birth control pack till last night (Wednesday).
13137,I started a new pack last night.
13138,"I did have sex a couple days ago, but we used the pull out method, like we always do."
13139,We do the birth control pill  the pull out method.
13140,Am I at risk for pregnancy?
13141,Is there anything specific I should be doing to get back on track with the birth control pill?
13142,Is there anything I should expect this month with my period?
13143,Will it come as usual?Thank you!

13147,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
13148,Sorry but I believe you are be at risk since you started a few days late and have had sex recently ( when did you have sex?
13149,If within 35 days you can take a plan b. if not then I would test 23 weeks from when you had it.
13150,"Sperm can live for up to 5 days so if you still had at least 5 days of the placebo days to go (i.e, sex was anytime before the 2nd placebo) then I wouldnt be too worried , but if not then take a plan b/test in few weeks."
13151,even though you pulled out i would be on the more cautious side thoigh it does decrease the risk.Also remember to use extra protection the first 7 days of this new pack.
13152,"Since you missed 23 actives given the Wednesday start , you are starting it as if the first time again snd are unprotected."
13153,"Sorry you are going through this, hope everything works out for you x"
13154,Thank you for your support and advice!
13155,I took a morning after pill yesterday.
13156,Emergency contraception should be considered if hormonal pills were missed during the first week and unprotected sexual intercourse occurred in the previous 5 days.
13157,It may also be considered at other times if appropriate.
13158,from Cornell
13159,Has anyone tried Junel 1/20 fe?
13160,"Im on month two and if gave me a bad yeast infection, and now Im having a lot of discomfort and burning."
13161,I went back in for another swab and they said theres nothing wrong.
13162,I cant even wipe without being in pain.
13163,Ive tried boric acid suppositories and have taken fish oil and nothing helps.
13164,At this point I think I cant tolerate the progesterone in this pill.
13165,"Today Im going to stop taking it for a week to see if my vagina heals and goes back to normal, but I wondered if anyone else has had this experience?"
13166,Ive been feeling with this for 11 days now and Im just so uncomfortable and miserable.

13170,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
13171,I have been on Junel Fe 1/20 for years and never had an issue.
13172,Birth control can't give you a yeast infection but it may increase the risk of getting one because it may change the pH level of your vagina.
13173,I would definitely talk to your provider.
13174,I did see my provider and they basically said the same thing you did.
13175,It doesnt make sense to me that this pill isnt the issue.
13176,Ive been on it for almost two months now and my vagina hates it.
13177,"I took three fluconazole last week, Ive used boric acid and Im still uncomfortable and sore."
13178,Ive been experiencing this since the 1st of this month.
13179,"Am i suppose to just keep taking it and hope it stops causing this, or do I stop taking it for a week and see if it helps?"
13180,"I even went back in for a second swab on Tuesday and nothing came back positive, but it still hurts to vibe and Im extremely uncomfortable."
13181,"No scented stuff, I dont douche, cotton underwear."
13182,I do all the things Im suppose to.
13183,That is frustrating and puzzling.
13184,I'm hoping one of the health professionals here can point you in the right direction.
13185,"If you find answers, or not, let us know!"
13186,Someone could have the same issue as you.
13187,I am on the mini pill.
13188,"I forgot to take it at my usual time of 8 pm on Tuesday, so I took it when I remembered at 8 am Wednesday morning."
13189,I then took my usual dose on Wednesday evening at 8 pm.
13190,I had unprotected sex later that evening at 10 pm.
13191,I finished my last period about a week ago.
13192,Is my risk high?
13193,Which mini pill?
13194,"If it is one of the 3 hour pills like norethindrone you're definitely at risk, can't say how high or anything though.But there are now two mini pills that have 1224 hour windows in which case you'd be pretty safe (desogestrel and drospirenone)."
13195,The mini pill only has a 3 hour window so they sex you had was unprotected

13200,Yeah unfortunately Im on Norethindrone.
13201,Is taking a plan b an option even though Ive resumed my normal pill routine?
13202,I believe it is an option because it would delay ovulation (which norethindrone doesn't always stop) but it's been a long time since I was on norethindrone so I would put your info into this tool and see what it recommends
13203,im on blisovi fe 1/20 and last night had unprotected sex with my trans girlfriend where she finished inside me and i fell asleep so fast i forgot to take my pill for the night.
13204,for other reasons i havent taken it this morning either and next chance i get to take it will be the time i usually take it am i at risk to get pregnant?
13205,"she takes estrogen so i think it affects her fertility which is why im mentioning it, wondering if that lowers the chances any?"

13221,Emergency contraception delays ovulation and therefore your period.
13222,Its normal r/planbs.
13223,You can test 2 weeks after sex for an accurate result and 3 weeks after for a definite one.
13224,Make sure to have a reliable Plan A in place.
13225,"for background, I have taken BC before but not for many many years."
13226,"My reasoning for getting back on (my doctor prescribed lo loestrin) is because my period is extremely sporadic  when I miss a period, will come in with debilitating cramps  very heavy."
13227,there have been times where I've had to go to the emergency room because of the painful cramps.
13228,the bloating and constipation is also an issue.
13229,"I'm not sure that could be solved by going on the pill, but thought perhaps it could if it regulates my period/hormones?I'm wondering if many people have had positive experiences on lo loestrin?"
13230,I think with BC it's easy to get distracted by the negative feedback only  that's what's given me pause to get back on it again.
13231,I know everyone's experience is different!
13232,but curious what the overall feelings have been.Is anyone on the minipill/progestrin only?
13233,"thoughts on that?grateful for any insight, thanks in advance."

13238,"I've been on both, Lolo in my late 30s and mini pill (norethindrone .35) in my mid 40s."
13239,I liked Lolo a lot  periods very light and no real side effects except spotting.
13240,Had maybe a little bloating at first but really I don't remember anything negative.
13241,I quit due to the cost.... insurance wouldn't cover and I ran out of sample packs.
13242,"But as for side effects I'd rate it a BThe mini pill was fine....noticed mood swings here and there the first couple months and a dip in libido, as well as mild fatigue and constipation."
13243,"On the plus side, my periods remained regular but got shorter and significantly lighter (I had crime scene periods before)!"
13244,"Overall I'd rate it a BI'm on Nexplanon now, and I bleed much less am less tired, and no more constipation."
13245,"Downsides are even lower libido, sore swollen boobs (for months), and more irritability and depression (which may be also from my horrible job)."
13246,"Of course, I am likely starting to be perimenopausal now so everything is up in the air."
13247,"I'd rate it a C. Of the three, I would probably say the Lolo is the winner but the minipill is so so cheap and also I did okay enough on it."
13248,All methods are very effective pregnancy prevention if taken correctly.
13249,I was really really good about always having the pack with me and taking it at exactly the same time  that is important with the minipill.
13250,And of course this is only my experience.
13251,Everyone is different.Hope this helps!
13252,thank you!!!
13253,"super helpful insight!my fears on side effects are mostly dip in libido, bloating/constipation  hair lossi know everyone is different but always good to get some opinions to compare."
13254,"Hi, so I take plan b after a mistake with my boyfriend, and one week after I started bleeding and my period was planned for 10 days later."
13255,"The blood look like the beginning or the end of period, and it's light, like I see it only on the toilet paper or a little bit on the pad (not like my regular period)."
13256,I never experienced spotting in my entire life.
13257,"I also have period cramp, but my real period are supposed to come now in 3 days and the bleeding from the plan b hasn't stopped."
13258,And I'm so stressed because it's been 1 week.
13259,"I know that plan b can make my cycle irregular, but l'm not gonna see it, because for about 45 months now my cycle is irregular, and before he was not (this is another problem)."
13260,"I never take the pills and never experienced that before when I take plan b. I'm a person who is very stressed in general, and i know that it can messed up a lot my cycle."
13261,"So, tell me if you ever experienced that or if you have advice?"

13274,"Its now mid September 2023 and for the past month at least, Ive had low grade to moderate cramps in my lower abdomen and midlower back."
13275,Ive also had slight bleeding thats a darker brown in color.
13276,"Not enough to wear a period product, but its every single day for a month now."
13277,Every time I wipe after using the bathroom.
13278,Has anyone else had these symptoms alongside taking Slynd?
13279,"Its taken away my actual periods, but having dull cramps every day and old looking blood that doesnt seem to stop is getting really uncomfortable."
13280,Does anyone know what this is and how if its related to the pills?
13281,"If it happened to you, when did it stop?"
13282,I just stopped taking slynd a few months ago after being on it for around 9 months or so.
13283,I had a lot of cramping and abnormal bleeding especially after being on it a few months.
13284,Ive never had the back cramps though.
13285,"Maybe talk to your doctor about it, but I know abnormal bleeding and cramps are common side effects."

13291,Wondering if anyone else had that side effect on slynd and how long it took to stop?
13292,I quit the pill 9 days ago
13293,Thanks for responding!
13294,Ive been keeping my doctor in the loop.
13295,Hello all.
13296,Im sorry if this has been asked before but google isnt yielding anything helpful to me.
13297,I am 38 and Ive been on the pill for 20 years.
13298,"For the last handful of years, Ive been on Sronyx/its various generic forms as changed by my insurance."
13299,My withdrawal bleeds have always been regular and timely.
13300,"The first day is light, 23 days moderate, day 45 light."
13301,Over the years Ive definitely missed a pill here or there but never more than one or two and I always get back on track right away.I had a normal withdrawal bleed last month though it showed up a few days later than normal.
13302,Took my next pack of pills without issue.
13303,"I expected my period to begin the week of 9/3, as this was placebo week."
13304,"On Saturday 9/2, I began spotting a light brown flow."
13305,I was a little surprised it was early but slapped on a panty liner and carried on.
13306,That same spotting continued for the next 7 days with no actual withdrawal flow as I had always known it.
13307,Then it just tapered off.
13308,Last night I noticed some mild cramping in my left pelvic region when I went to bed.
13309,It didnt bother me after I fell asleep.
13310,"I noticed it intermittently throughout the day today.Im a natural worrywart, I guess, and Im wondering if I should take a pregnancy test."
13311,"Or if I should be worried about something like a cyst, or some other issue that hasnt occurred to me."
13312,Has anyone experienced this?

13320,I HAVE NOTICED THIS!

13322,It's honestly normal?
13323,"I have no clue, but I'm on liletta and it's annoying and freaks me out, but now it's just a way of life."
13324,"Im having the same problem, but I havent had a withdrawal bleed (yet) im so scared Im pregnant."
13325,Last month it came a day early (usually saturday and then it was friday).
13326,Im having no symptoms besides a faint cramp on my left pelvic region.
13327,I had unprotected sex about two days ago during ovulation.
13328,"Im on tri lo milli and also used spermicide, should I consider the morning after pill?"
13329,I was 12 hours late to one of my birth control doses about a week ago.
13330,You do not ovulate on the combo pill.
13331,Youre protected.
13332,Youre protected by your pill.

13361,Hi all.
13362,I (F31) recently stopped taking the mini pill and was convinced to try the IUB Ballarine.
13363,I've only had it for a week but wanted to start a post on my experience.
13364,Why did I stop taking the mini pill?
13365,"Long story short, it was sucking all the joy out of my life."
13366,This might sound a bit dramatic but this is literally how I felt!
13367,Confirmed by how much better I feel now.
13368,"I've tried different pills over the years, but artificial hormones just don't agree with me."
13369,So why IUB Ballarine?
13370,I'd never heard of it before my doctor informed me it existed.
13371,It's a new 3D spherical copper coil that is supposed to be uterus friendly.
13372,No hormones and I should be protected from pregnancy for up to 5 years.
13373,Which suits my partner and I.
13374,If we aren't ready for kids by then he can get a vasectomy.
13375,"(I'm joking, sort of..) I read about the insertion process and how it can be painful."
13376,This part I underestimated.
13377,"I went to the appointment while on my period, and after taking the uterine softening pill as instructed."
13378,I also took some solpadine max 30 min before.
13379,"( If there is a next time, it will be neurophen plus an hour before hand)."
13380,"Anyways, even with the painkillers it was the worse cramps I've ever had in my life."
13381,The insertion itself was quick less than 10 min.
13382,"But I was faint afterwards, this is a known symptom but I'm glad my sister was with me."
13383,I also had the appointment at 6pm which is good because there is no way I could have gone back to work with the pain.
13384,Fast forward a week and the pain has greatly subsided but I do still have some bleeding.
13385,"My doctor recommended that I don't use tampons for 6 weeks, which is sad cause I find pads uncomfortable but I can deal."
13386,No baths or sex for two weeks either.
13387,Just to decrease the risk of infection.
13388,I have a follow up appointment in November so I can post an update then if people are interested.
13389,So far I am hopeful this is the right contraception for me.
13390,If you have any questions feel free to reach out.
13391,I'm happy to help if I can.

13397,"The mini pill was making me feel miserable, so I wanted to try something different."
13398,The IUB Ballarine is a hormonefree copper coil that provides protection from pregnancy for up to 5 years.
13399,"The insertion process was painful, even with painkillers, but the pain has subsided after a week."
13400,"I'm following some precautions, like not using tampons and avoiding baths and sex for two weeks, to reduce the risk of infection."
13401,I have a followup appointment in November.
13402,"Overall, I'm hopeful that this contraception method works well for me."
13403,Feel free to ask any questions.
13404,What are the chances of getting pregnant under the following conditions1.
13405,Day 5 of the menstrual cycle.2.
13406,"Didn't ejaculate inside, might have released a ""few drops of precum"", which might contain sperms from a previous ejaculation which was 30 mins ago.Should we concider morning after pill?"
13407,If so which one?
13408,And does it have adverse side effects for one time use only?Please advice.

13415,The potential side effects of the pill come listed on the pamphlet that comes with it.
13416,r/planbs
13417,I 31F was on the nuvaring (which I was good with) but my doctor switched me to Deblitane since I was diagnosed with lupus.
13418,I'm currently on my third week of the pack and I can see a huge shift.
13419,The first couple weeks I felt normal but now I feel like a zombie while also wanting to cry every second.
13420,I feel so unbelievably anxious.
13421,"Headaches, back pain, fatigue, nausea, dizziness."
13422,I know they say it takes 3 months to really regulate hormones but I don't know if I can live like this.
13423,I'm too scared to get an IUD but she also mentioned the depo shot being an option.
13424,Has anyone had a good experience with that?
13425,I know it's obviously different for everyone but willing to try.

13431,"Is it weird after reading all horror stories about birth control, I just want to continue with Ipill?"
13432,"I know it is an emergency but as far as I have learnt, there is no perfect healthy birth control  even not having uterus  How many max I can take Ipill in a month (personal score 4 random times in a month),  I have found you can take 2 ipills in a month without any major problem  is that right?Self disclaimer I know I should visit doctor but I want to first have my Own research, also somehow super scared and awkward to go to doctor as nonmarried, sexually active, person in Indian society  as, I don't want be judged"
13433,Emergency contraception is supposed to be a plan b for various reasons.
13434,"Firstly, it is not as effective as other birth control."
13435,"Even if taken correctly, it is maximum 90 effective."
13436,"However, for people over a certain weight it is less effective, and it does not work at all if you have already ovulated."
13437,It is extremely difficult to track ovulation.
13438,"It is much less effective than actual birth control.Secondly, plan b uses synthetic hormones, just like birth control, which is what all the horror stories are about."
13439,"However, plan b uses a massive dose of hormones  much higher than in birth control."
13440,"Therefore, it is more likely to cause worse side effects."
13441,"Also, your body takes a while to adjust to hormones, so usually with birth control that you take consistently, the side effects subside after a while."
13442,The same cannot be said with taking plan b  your body does not get adjusted to it.
13443,The horror stories are just that  horror stories.
13444,"For the majority of people, birth control works fine and can even have some benefits."
13445,You won't know unless you try.
13446,"There are technically no limits to how often you can take plan b in a month, but I really wouldn't advise it, and neither would any doctor."
13447,"If you are scared of the hormones in birth control, you should also be scared of the hormones in plan b."
13448,"Not to say you should be scared of either, but your reasoning here is not logical."
13449,"I totally get you are scared of being judged, but overall birth control is much more effective."

13455,I been waiting for months to get my Kyleena IUD placed.
13456,"My provider advised me to come on my cycle because the cervix will be more ""open"" and won't be too uncomfortable compared to not being on a cycle."
13457,"I did everything I had to do, popped an Ibuprofen an hour before."
13458,Only thing is I didn't come on my cycle bc it was hard for me to schedule around it with work and whatnot.
13459,"As I sit and have her probe up my vagina,  the first few minutes feels like a papsmear, what she called ""cleaning the area"" prior to insertion."
13460,She then uses the instrument to I guess attempt to measure my cervix and she couldn't go all the way because my cervix was closed like fort knox.
13461,In which she reassured me its supposed to be closed.
13462,First attempt nada.
13463,"Second attempt she gets the MA to get her a bigger pair of, I don't know the medical term but tongs, to try opening up my cervix."
13464,She then says I may not be a candidate bc my cervix is small.
13465,The cramps suckes and of course bleeding to be expected with that kind of trauma up there.
13466,Has anyone experienced this before?
13467,I told her eff that and give me the oral birth control pill.
13468,Maybe in the future I'll attempt but dang being a responsible woman is difficult.

13480,Yep!

13487,"I had my bloodwork done in June, and my doctor thought it was low vitamin D levels."
13488,"Ive been on 50k UIs, 2x a week since then with no change."
13489,"I took my last active pill September 2nd, had my ""period"",  but haven't had any other bleeding."
13490,Is this normal since I stopped ahead of a placebo week vs in the middle of a pack?
13491,Does it mean my ovulation is jacked up?

13505,"I have been on the copper iud, which i have been loving."
13506,"However, the issue is that it keeps wanting to fall out."
13507,"I've had it replaced 3 times in the past year with different shapes hoping it would stick, but unfortunately not.My question is what kind of birth control, apart from a nonhormal iud (or iuds in general since they don't want to stick) has the least side effects."
13508,"I don't have issues with weight or acne at the moment, and don't really care if my periods get heavier or lighter."
13509,"I just need something that is similar to the copper iud, if that's possible."
13510,"If you're talking about effectiveness, the only nonhormonal methods that have the same effectiveness rate as the copper IUD are sterilization (vasectomy, tubal litigations, etc).If you're specifically focusing on side effects, condoms would fit the bill, and if you don't like condoms, you can also try a diaphragm."
13511,"When it comes to nonhormonal methods that aren't the copper IUD or sterilization, I recommend combining at least 2 (condoms plus pulling out, diaphragm plus fertility awareness, spermicide plus condom, etc) so that if one method fails, you have a backup."
13512,Would you be interested in the methods over at r/FAMnNFP ?
13513,"It's a bit of work and not for everyone, but definitely no side effects."
13514,Evra patch
13515,This combined with condoms and abstaining on fertile days can work quite good.
13516,I'm an atheist btw but had side effects on the pill and too afraid of an IUD.
13517,"For my PCOS, I started taking Yaz last year December for 6 months and noticed that my period always comes on the first or second pink pill of the next pack rather than on the white pills of the previous pack."
13518,I stopped taking it last May and just started again this month but Im worried that the same thing might happen.
13519,Im wondering if this means anything?
13520,Is it abnormal?
13521,"I take it every single day at the same time, but Im worried about that being an indicator that the pill isnt working or that my risk of pregnancy is higher.Does my period coming on the first/second day of the next pack instead of the previous packs white pills mean that my risk of pregnancy is higher?TYIA!"

13535,So I was on the Mirena coil for 5yrs and have just had Kyleena as my replacement.
13536,"The Mirena worked great, although I'm not sure if it was the root of gaining weight."
13537,"Over 2yrs I put on 2 stone or so, then 18 months ago the weight just seemed to drop off me n I'm now prepregnancy weight for the first time in 10yrs!!"
13538,"Yet I hadn't changed anything with exercise, diet etc so not sure what happened."
13539,I also found my face ended up with quite bad acne and rosacea from just after starting the mirena.
13540,I'm just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences on Mirena and changed to Kyleena and if weight/skin got any better with the lower hormones... or any other symptoms from kyleena?

13545,Ive been on Junel Fe 1/20 combo pill for 4 months.
13546,Before I started the pill I was 129lbs and now I am 141lbs.
13547,Ive always been a fairly skinny person so this jump is a lot for me and its really affecting my self esteem.
13548,I went to the doctor today to discuss this and asked her if I will continue to gain weight or will I reach a baseline and stop gaining weight.
13549,She basically said she didnt know and its hard to know when or if that will happen.
13550,Im really scared cause I dont want it to get to the point that I become obese.
13551,I have noticed I am a lot hungrier on the pill and I constantly want to snack.
13552,I dont have the best diet either but it was never an issue before because I had a fast metabolism but now I guess my food really does impact my weight.
13553,I also think Im gaining water weight too.
13554,I just dont know what to do.
13555,Im scared to try any other pill.
13556,This is the first BC ive ever been on and its been good in a lot of other ways!
13557,Im too scared to try anything else or a different method and I really dont want to continue to gain weight and become unhealthy!
13558,Please give me some tips if you can.
13559,You are likely gaining weight because you are eating more due to being hungry you will stop gaining weight when you reach a point where the amount you are eating reflects the amount of energy it takes for you to maintain that weight.
13560,"I dont know if that will be at 141lbs, 150lbs or 200."
13561,Birth control made me very hungry and I had to keep track of my calories by weighing my food/ingredients.
13562,I could no longer trust my body to give me reasonable hunger cues.
13563,"I also worked out very very regularly, 57 days a week."
13564,On the last pill I was on I still gained some weight.
13565,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.

13568,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
13569,i was in the same boat as you which is why i switched to non hormonal bc.
13570,only difference is it actually happened to me after 4 years of taking junel fe.
13571,ive never had any struggles with my weight or body so it was really hard on me and when it lasted for more than a year and because i still felt uncomfortable i decided that i needed to get off of it.
13572,"it was amazing i had gone 21 years without body issues, no need to introduce them now."
13573,coming off was hard too though because i lost the 20lbs i had gained within weeks of stopping so i felt really weird at first.
13574,it took a couple months to lose the weight i gained in my face though
13575,I definitely gained on my pill (Yaz) and then I had hormonal imbalances which made me gain more.
13576,I was on it for 15 years.
13577,(I used to be 100125 and ended at 155 over that timeframe).
13578,I think the timeframe to even out is 36 months so you might be ok.
13579,I highly recommend tracking what you are eating and using a scale to measure portions.
13580,Yaz definitely made me really hungry.
13581,I recently got off birth control (month 2) and my hunger is a lot less now and Im starting to lose weight.
13582,Periods suck more now but cant win them all!
13583,Please just make sure youre taking care of yourself.
13584,"Idk how old you are, but our bodies change as we age."
13585,"Youll gain weight, wrinkle, etc but starting to weigh your food or count calories can very quickly lead to an ED."
13586,"I had one and it sucks, recovery sucks, it all sucks."
13587,I took junel and didnt experience weight gain and am on yaz now and also didnt experience weight gain.
13588,I have gained weight though because Im not 18 anymore.
13589,Your metabolism will change and thats fine!
13590,"If you feel the pill is impacting you significantly in this aspect, talk with your doctor about a different pill/hormone level or non hormonal options."
13591,"Regardless, fluctuating weight isnt the end of the work and it can be changed with lifestyle changes."
13592,Just please make sure you take care of yourself
13593,I dont understand what you mean by I will stop gaining weight when I reach a point where the amount I am eating reflects the amount of energy it takes for me to maintain that weight.
13594,I am very scared of becoming obese and I have never had to watch what I eat or work out because before birth control I was eating whatever I wanted and didnt work out because my weight was stable.
13595,So I dont really know how to watch what I eat.
13596,I am 29 and this weight difference is very sudden for me.
13597,I have always eaten whatever I wanted and not gained a significant amount of weight.
13598,I have gained 13 pounds since starting birth control and I think it is because it is making me more hungry more often.
13599,I just want to snack all the time.
13600,I dont think watching what I eat will trigger an ED for me.
13601,It just seems so sudden for my weight to go up this much pretty much as soon as I started birth control so I think that is what is causing this.
13602,This is my first time on any birth control and this pill is working great for me otherwise so I am scared to change and have a bad experience.
13603,It means that if you are maintaining 150 pounds you are eating enough to maintain that weight.
13604,If you are eating enough to maintain 150 pounds youll gain weight and taper off because your 150 pound body will be using that energy to maintain itself.Idk what to tell you.
13605,If its making you hungry and youre gaining weight because of that you are in a position where you can let it happen (legit!)
13606,"or you can watch what you eat, or stop the pill or switch the pillYoud have to learn?"
13607,"But if it will give you an eating disorder or something maybe consider a non hormonal bc, or a different pill and see if it doesnt have that side effect."
13608,I guess ultimately its up to you on what to do since weight gain is the only negative symptom.
13609,"Based on what Ive read here, people have gained weight on junel and yaz whereas Ive taken both and didnt experience that it just goes to show its different for everyone!"
13610,Maybe look into other pills I switched mine from junel to yaz bc I reacted horribly to a generic brand and had horrible acne.
13611,Im so glad I switched because that symptom is gone now.
13612,You may or may not like other pills but there are lots of options out there to try.
13613,Maybe ask your doctor about other pills or an iud?
13614,If that is a good option for you.
13615,Good luck!
13616,I am wanting to try boric acid suppositorieswhat should I know before trying them?

13623,Only use it if your pH is actually off.
13624,It doesnt interfere with birth control.
13625," Make sure you wear a pad/panty liner and sleep with a towel under you, definitely dont recommend using one during the day either, they get pretty messy."
13626,Theyve helped exponentially with reoccurring bv from the birth control I was on at the time.

13628,Suppositories are perfectly safe and can help prevent infections like BV.
13629,Plenty of doctors recommend them.
13630,"I posted this in r/pregnant as well, but probably will find better answers here."
13631,So reposting the same.Hi!
13632,I have a question about tubal ligation.
13633,Has anyone done it and regretted it later or on the contrary was happy about it?
13634,Is there something I need to think about/ consider before I do it?Just a bit of background.
13635,I am 38 y.o.
13636,I have a 6 yo boy and now I am 33 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child.
13637,"I've wanted only one child initially, my husband wanted two, but then we agreed that one is enough as his health is not great and also from financial standpoint.But I got pregnant again."
13638,It was not planned.
13639,"I cried for a couple of days and even considered abortion for a bit, but then came to the conclusion that I wouldn't be able to to do it even though I'm prochoice."
13640,For myself the idea seemed impossible and I realized I want that child.
13641,It would be good for the whole family.
13642,Now my 2nd pregnancy is much worse than the 1st.
13643,"I lost 11 lbs in the first 3 months from constant morning sickness, I have anemia, hyperthyroidism, gestational diabetes and all the other ""pleasant"" things that normally go with it."
13644,I hate putting my body through it.
13645,I'm tired.
13646,"I have a scheduled csection and wanted to do tubal ligation at the same time, so I can close this shop.My husband is not keen on the idea, but after I tried talking to him he said ""do whatever you want""."
13647,He doesn't want to do vasectomy.
13648,"I feel like I have right to decide here, cause it's my body that's being put through the ringer."
13649,It's not easy for me to get pregnant (we were not doing any form of contraception for 1.5 years before I got pregnant 2nd time).
13650,"I also don't want to do any hormonal contraceptives (low libido, weight gain, risks)."
13651,"I had nonhormonal IUD, but hated it, it was painful and I had spotting all the time."
13652,I don't like condoms.
13653,"Pulling out was our only method for many many years before I got pregnant with my 1st, but I would still live on edge every month."
13654,I am anxious though that tubal ligation is so final.
13655,"I feel I'm ready to close this shop, but my husband not being supportive of my decision makes me doubt it."
13656,"Yes, it's my body, but we are a family.So if you have any advice or insight on this, I'd greatly appreciate it.P.S."
13657,Sorry for the long post.
13658,I tend to share too many details probably.
13659,"Instead of a tubal ligation, try to get a bisalp(tube removal)."
13660,"With a ligation, there can be a chance of it failing."
13661,I had a bisalp and I've had zero kids prior.
13662,"I don't regret it one bit.You and your husband You've always wanted one, but he wants two kids."
13663,The second child is coming in due time.
13664,You both already have differences in how many kids you want.
13665,You're also not financially well off.
13666,"Your second pregnancy is also unplanned, so there's a lot of emotional turmoil there."
13667,Your current pregnancy is also rough on your body.You seem like you want to be done having kids for good.
13668,He doesn't seem to be.
13669,"Again, that's another difference between you two."
13670,Your husband doesn't want a vasectomy.
13671,"I get it, his body his choice, but maybe he's looking to have more kids in the future, or he's afraid of having a basic surgery."
13672,Getting sterilized as a woman is much more invasive than a vasectomy for a man.
13673,If you're on the fence about getting sterilized don't do it.
13674,"At the end of the day, you do what you want."
13675,"Once it's done, it's done."
13676,"I get you would feel better having his support, but sometimes you just have to rely on yourself."
13677,"Sorry if this doesn't seem like any advice, maybe more like a rant."
13678,I just get angry when men expect women to be the sole responsibility of anything BC.
13679,"You should visit r/childfree too, many had the tubal or bisalp there."

13684,Hello Reddit!
13685,I'm new to Yasmin and birth control in general.
13686,Taken it once in my teens.
13687,Spotting after taking the pills back to back.
13688,So took my first 21 days pack and then no break and I'm probably on the 8tn day of the 2nd pack.
13689,I've been spotting for like 5 days now.
13690,Just found blood on my tissue at first but it's increased for the past 2 to 3 days.
13691,Should I be worried?
13692,Has anyone experienced this as a first time user?

13700, iud replaced on 8/19 and had severe pain after that subsided eventually.
13701,then just random severe cramps that would last for around an hour since i got an x ray of my hips on 8/24 that showed my iud was completely horizontal and that i should get it checked up onappt with my gyno 9/9th and they did an ultrasound and said it was perforating and to immediately go to the er.
13702,i go to the er and they do an ultrasound and said it wasnt perforating at all and it was not emergent and sent me homei love my gyno and trust them a lot so im not sure what to think

13710,A good Multivitamin with magnesium is usually a good place to start!
13711,From there you can add more supps if needed.You can ignore the other commenter.
13712,I am on vitex which is a supplement with clear evidence supporting its effectiveness.

13720,Do you find it helpful for overall maintenance?
13721,That's good!
13722,Definitely try to eat nutrient dense foods and allow yourself to rest.
13723,"I don't have pcos, just low progesterone which vitex helps, but I wouldn't recommend anything that can raise or lower hormones before having a hormone test."
13724,And if you don't have any negative symptoms coming off and you get your period within a few months you won't even need a test.
13725,I already called for a full panel blood test so its definitely smart for me to put a pause on anything that will directly affect the hormone levels.
13726,I think Im so worried about avoiding the crash that Im trying to be proactive.
13727,Thank you for your advice!
13728,Vitamin and mineral panel is always a good idea!
13729,I had magnesium deficiency associated with the pill
13730,Hello everyone.
13731,Has anyone switched from the birth control Slynd to the IUD (progesterone) and if so what differences were there?
13732,I (35F) am thinking of getting an IUD and stopping Slynd for a few reasons and want to know if anyone has done the same.Firstly Slynd is not co paid by the government in Spain so the price has been creeping up and an IUD would be free.
13733,"Secondly I feel my side effects could be lessened with more localised hormones (bloating, diahorrea, constipation)."
13734,Did anyone make the switch?
13735,"I have PCOS, fibroids and suspected endo and can't take estrogen."
13736,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.

13739,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
13740,I havent taken Slynd but I have the mirena iud.
13741,Its the only fda approved birth control to help lessen heavy periods.
13742,Im a very heavy bleeder.
13743,It did increase my 7 period days to 10 for first two months.
13744,It was my last option and I also cant take estrogen.
13745,It can increase period flow and days the first 6 months so its a bit of a wait out.
13746,After 6 months my periods stopped.
13747,Ive had it 5.5 years still no periods.
13748,No cramps.
13749,However a few months ago I did start pmsing again even without periods.
13750,My boobs have been sore for 10 days now.
13751,Its gone down with intensity but this is getting annoying and I hope it goes away soon.
13752,If it matters Im 33.
13753,Slynd wasnt available when I got Mirena so thats why Ive never tried it.
13754,I was on MonoLinyah or similar pill for 13 years.
13755,"Im off for now 3 months to try to work out some medical issues Ive been having, and also see if some of my mental health issues improved by getting off the pill."
13756,"I have PCOS, but all of my blood markers have improved."
13757,My mental health is also improving.
13758,Yet I still have no cycle and my hair is falling out.
13759,"I had a lot of hair to begin with, so I dont think its noticeable to anyone but myself."
13760,But 35 strands fall out every time I touch my hair and gobs come out in the shower.
13761,It feels about 20 thinner than 3 or 4 months ago.
13762,"I know I need to fix whatever underlying hormonal issue is causing the hair loss, but does anyone have any tips or things that worked for them to slow down postpill hair loss?"

13767,Just wondering if anyone else feels mood changes within a few days of starting a new pill?
13768,Doc says it takes 3 months for full side effect experience but I swear I can feel it start almost immediately!
13769,"I took Generess Fe for about 10 years and had no issues with it until the very end, where I started getting extreme vulvar irritation (wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy lol it was absolutely miserable)."
13770,"Of course the BC was the last thing my doc or I suspected since Id been on it for so long, but once I stopped taking it the problem vanished."
13771,I didnt take a new BC immediately because I wanted to let my system reset after all that.
13772,"I didnt get a period for about 6 months, and ended up developing severe acne."
13773,"Went to the gyno and was diagnosed with PCOS based off of my FSH levels, although Im in the lowest percentile for many of the other common symptoms (no obesity, insulin resistance, or painful periods)."
13774,It made sense but part of me felt like the old BC mightve just thrown my system off for a while.
13775,"I started taking Yasmin for contraceptive purposes and did well with it for about 1.5 years and my acne went away, but then I started feeling like it was making me unreasonably moody and emotional."
13776,I switched to a different brand (I forgot the name but it was a different type than the ones I previously took) but discontinued it after a few days because I felt insanely moody.
13777,"This was about 6 months ago, and I havent been taking anything because I wanted to see what my body would do as I was still having trouble believing the PCOS diagnosis."
13778,"My periods have been on time every 28 days, they were light and only lasted about 2 days, and I didnt have any issues."
13779,I reported this to my gyno but she said that PCOS symptoms can come and go.
13780,"Past 12 months, however, my acne has slowly been creeping back and I noticed moderatetosevere fatigue (it was actually pretty debilitating this month) during PMS."
13781,I made the decision to try BC again and settled on Yaz.
13782,Ive been taking it for 3 days now and I swear I feel more emotional than before I took it.
13783,"I feel like 3 days may not be enough time to actually be experiencing any real side effects, maybe its a placebo effect or my imagination."
13784,But Im also wondering if I may just be very sensitive to BCs in general?
13785,Has anyone else had a similar experience?
13786,Any other ideas of what I could maybe try?

13800,Ive heard Yaz is approved to treat pms and pmdd.
13801,I have pmdd but I have the mirena iud for sex and bad periods.
13802,I cant take estrogen so Ive never tried yaz.
13803,ive had the Kyleena IUD since late December 2021 and have never missed a period.
13804,"sometimes they were light, sometimes super heavy but since May this year, theyve gotten increasingly lighter and reduced to minimal spotting for about 35 days."
13805,"my last period was the first week of august, and my period this month was predicted to come on 9/2  ive yet to have a period."
13806,"i took a test last thursday and it was negative, but now concerned and confused."
13807,"last night i took 2 of the first response rapid results with one of them showing a digital yes, another cheap test from buccees that took a while to show a negative line (not sure if i peed entirely on it tbh), and another one this morning that showed a negative result."
13808,"however, when i took the two last night, i dunked the digital one into the toilet bowl bc i wasnt sure if i peed on it or not."
13809,"could that have caused an error in the positive reading, or should i see a doctor or take another test?if its important to note  ive never had a scare since having the IUD and my boyfriend does not pull out during sex."
13810,"and to my knowledge, there have been 0 issues with IUD placement."
13811,Its pretty much impossible to get a false positive.
13812,Im not a medical professional but I strongly urge you to see your doctor ASAP as the IUD can cause ectopic pregnancies (where the embryo attaches outside of the uterus).
13813,Best case scenario is the kyleena is just doing its thing and your periods are progressively getting lighter due to the hormones.
13814,Im on the Mirena (1.5yrs) and have noticed my periods are lighter and lighter each time.

13830,I was recently taken off the combined pill (Rigevidon) due to visual migraines.
13831,The reason I went on it is because my periods were heavy and I got uncomfortable cramps which I absolutely dreaded.
13832,It worked so well for me for about 34 years but I got migraines last year once every so many months.
13833,The nurse put me on Desogestrel but im now on my second period?
13834,She did ask me if I was sexually active which I said I was but I feel as if she missed the part of why I went on it in the first place.
13835,"My periods are lighter but they are still heavy, and I get more uncomfortable cramps."
13836,Ive been on it for less than 4 weeks now so its frustrating to get a full blown period when the reason I went on the pill is to reduce symptoms and not get a period itself.
13837,Will my periods stop overtime or shall I request for a new pill?
13838,So I have not taken desogestrel but am on a different progestin only pill (Slynd  drospirenone).
13839,"It's never a guarantee but your bleeding should get much less over time and possibly stop entirely, 4 weeks is still pretty early to see results unfortunately."
13840,It took about 6 months before I really stopped getting a period at all with Slynd but it did get lighter and lighter in that time.
13841,"I would try to stick it out longer if you can, but there are other progestin only pills to try if this one doesn't work for you, or of course nonpill progestin only methods."

13846,I've had Kyleena IUD for the past 5 years and just got the old one removed and a new one put in at the same appointment.
13847,"The first time I had an IUD put in, I vaguely remember having spotting on and off for a while, and some heavier bleeding at one point, but then barely had a period for the past 4.5 years which was awesome."
13848,"I was hoping that since I already had an IUD, the post insertion spotting wouldn't be as bad and would resolve faster."
13849,So naively assumed I wouldn't have any spotting lol.
13850,It's only day 2 and I'm crossing my fingers it won't last long.
13851,"I really don't want to deal with the spotting for months again, even though I know its worth it in the long run."
13852,"Looking for some posts so I know what to expect this time around, but I cant seem to find anyone talking about their experiences with getting an IUD replaced."
13853,Can anyone who's gotten more than 1 IUD share their experience with replacement?
13854,Is it like the same adjustment/recovery period as the first?
13855,Or did you find it was easier/had less spotting since you had one before?

13860,"my bf and I had sex, with condom."
13861,"Nothing happened on the condom, it was still perfectly intact, though he ejaculated inside, with the condom."
13862,The condom is in perfect condition.
13863,"It's a first, so I'm kind of paranoid and all."
13864,So I took emergency contraceptive pill the morning after that.
13865,"And now I'm experiencing the side effects, and I'm having really painful menstrual cramps."
13866,So are condoms really reliable?
13867,I heard some are using it as a birth control for years or maybe decades.
13868,"if the condom was completely intact upon pull out, you have no reason to worry."
13869,"if he ejaculated and it didnt leak out, you shouldnt have taken PlanB.simply, youre going to be okay.if used correctly, condoms are reliable  especially if you actually CHECK to see if everything is still in it.if this still makes you paranoid, definitely consider other options for peace of mind!"
13870,"Yes they are and the likelihood of getting pregnant even without one is somewhat slim, getting pregnant isnt as easy as everyone thinks it is."
13871,It can depend on where youre at in your menstrual cycle and a number of other things such as weight etc.
13872,"Still obviously doesnt mean you shouldnt use protection because its still possible.Nothing at all to be worried about, they are the most common form of birth control and used by practically everyone."
13873,Unless they are on the pill or IUD etc which dont require them.

13878,So long as the condom is used correctly it is perfectly reliable.
13879,Breakages are almost always user error.
13880,"Use water based lube always, doesnt matter how wet you are condoms dont slide easily without lube."
13881,Dry friction will cause tearing in both you and the condom.
13882,Make sure the fit and storage are correct and that the condom is not expired.
13883,"Make sure he holds the base when he pulls out (which should be immediately after orgasm, no extra thrusting) to ensure the condom stays on him fully."
13884,"Do all that every time, youre protected."
13885,"When I was tracking temps and cm, we used condoms during my fertile window."
13886,We never had any scares or condoms break.
13887,"Used properly, condoms are really effective.Also just a heads up the plan B could delay your period and make your cycle wonky a few months so just be prepared that that could happen."
13888,Absolutely no need for you to have taken Plan B  a massive dose of unnecessary hormones that will screw with your body for a while now.
13889,You used a condom.
13890,Condom intact.
13891,You sensibly had a Plan A.What is it with sex education wherever you are?
13892,You 'heard' that people use Condoms?
13893,okay.

13897,"oh,okay okay."
13898,I've been on Estarylla for about 2 1/2 years.
13899,All of a sudden I've been majorly bleeding in between periods.
13900,It started last month about 2 weeks before my period was due.
13901,I would have bright red blood and sore breasts.
13902,Then I got my period and it was normal.
13903,Now I've been off my period for about a weekish and it's happening again.
13904,Super sore breasts and bright red blood when I wipe.
13905,"x200BSince starting Estarylla I've gotten sore breasts a few days before my period, but never spotting like this and never THIS sore... Any insight?"

13912,Maybe there's something up with the pills?
13913,I've never really spotted before and have been lightly spotting for a couple days now and not supposed to get my period until next week.
13914,ive been on estarylla for 5 years and get intense breast  nipple pain at super random times.
13915,every few months or so.
13916,also get occasional break through bleeding.
13917,must be the brand.
13918,i havent had any other issues with it though
13919,I ended up stopping it!
13920,I made an appointment with my OB I need to switch I think the side effects were too much
13921,Good luck!!
13922,I think I may consider doing the same depending on how the next couple months ago
13923,So I stopped taking it like 3 days ago and my breasts stopped hurting and the bleeding has almost stopped.
13924,I accidentally forgot to take my pill on Friday and didnt realize until Saturday.
13925,I took both fries at and Saturdays pills on Saturday.
13926,I started having some spotting on Sunday.
13927,It stopped on Monday and then had continued since.
13928,I am on week two of my pack of birthcontrol.
13929,Its 21 days of hormones and then 7 days of placebo.
13930,How do is stop the spotting?

13945,Various neuro issues including dizziness.
13946,I'm not sure what they did to fix but I know it's not uncommon.
13947,really looking for a birth control that wont cause weight gain.
13948,any suggestions?
13949,"Copper IUD baby, no hormones to bother with"
13950,The only method that has been directly linked to weight gain is the depo shot.
13951,"Other methods may cause changes in appetite that lead to weight gain or changes in water retention which causes weight gain (not fat, just water).What works best for you may take some trial and error to figure out."
13952,I just came off of lo loestrin fe and lost 5ish pounds without changing anything.
13953,Maybe avoid that one?
13954,But everyones different.
13955,Its more increased appetite vs weight gain.
13956,The weight gain comes from eatingand like some have said water retention.
13957,Copper IUD ) I went from the pill to the IUD and with lifestyle changes as well I lost 13 lbs
13958,Absolutely do not to Nexplanon
13959,"Well, in my personal experience, Ive been using the NuvaRing for 7 months and I havent noticed a change in my weight or appetite."
13960,"I used to be on the pill a few years ago and I gained a lot of weight, I was afraid it would happen this time so I paid a lot of attention to my weight and the changes I could feel."
13961,Excess progestogen causes weight gain of your appetite is stimulated and you eat more.
13962,Excess oestrogen causes water retention and sometimes a little weight gain around stomach and hips.
13963,r/FAMnNFP
13964,"I use nexplanon literally didnt gain any weight, I actual lost weight."
13965,Theres not a sure way of knowing if itll make you gain or not its different for everybody.
13966,In my experience a lot of them cause weight gain and are likely to.
13967,"If you want to be sure it wont, just use condoms (not sure if you need it for contraception or other reasons but yeah), thats what I do because I also couldnt stand the weight gain."
13968,Pullout method.

13979,Ive been on eluryng (generic nuvaring) for a few months now and havent gained weight yet.
13980,If anything it decreased my appetite because of how depressed and anxious Ive felt on it

13984,"It totally ruined my thyroid, and now I have lifelong hormonal/ thyroid issues."
13985,Second this!!!!!!!!!!
13986,absolutely love mine
13987,Yeah my birth control (pill) caused a bit of weight gain but it was water weight.
13988,I don't know if you can find anything that's completely free of changing your weight because birth control is very hormonal and is a big adjustment for your body.
13989,I was always told bc was like Cinderella's shoe.
13990,Most people will try a few before they find one that fits them.
13991,i second this.
13992,made me gain weight too.
13993,Thanks!
13994,"I know for one thing that most people would first think, and no Im not pregnant for the reason that I havent had any sexual activity for many years."
13995,"Im currently on Tyblume, which overall has been treating me like heaven compared to when I took lo loestrin fe 3 months ago."
13996,I started taking Tyblume 3 months ago but very recently changed the time I take my pill.
13997,I used to take it at 1030 am.
13998,I switched it to taking it at 1130 pm because I kept having stuff come up at 1030 am.
13999,"mainly church on Sundays conflicted cause I always need to check the time that its been 30 minutes since I took my pill so I can eat (instructions say I have to take it on an empty stomach, for at least 30 minutes  for medications that require to take on an empty stomach."
14000,But noooooo I cannot check the time during church cause theres no clock and checking the time seems to be considered rude at my church (Ive received the stink eye from multiple people and at least one different person clearing their throat in an obviously rude way whenever I checked my watch at church ).
14001,No wonder I dont see young women at my church.
14002,Just extremely old people that definitely dont take birth control.
14003,"Last sunday when I had nausea because I didnt eat for over an hour after taking my pill and thinking, dont throw up."
14004,"Dont throw up, that was the last straw as far as putting up with that conflict, which is when I decided to change the time I took my pill.Ive tried taking it in the afternoon, but that definitely didnt work as something always came up anytime in the afternoon."
14005,So SURELY nothing is going to come up at 1130 pm (things come up as late as 1115 pm in my life).This nausea started the first day I changed the time of taking my pill.
14006,It mostly occurs when I wake up now.
14007,When will my body adjust to the change?
14008,I hate nausea .

14107,"It could, it depends on the supplement."
14108,Dont take supplements without first consulting with your doctor.
14109,"Before anyone suggests, I'm definitely making an appointment with my gyno about this to help, but I wanted to ask everyone here if anyone has been allowed to take this approach?Hormonal birth control and my body have never quite agreed..."
14110,"I was on depoprovera (the birth control shot) for a few years, and while it definitely stopped me from getting pregnant, it messed with my sex drive and made me very depressed and manic."
14111,"I pretty much never got wet, and, at 23 years old (a few years back) I needed lube or I couldn't get wet."
14112,"Additionally, my very high sex drive got pretty low."
14113,"I rarely wanted sex despite loving it.In the last year or so, I began to experience endometriosis symptoms."
14114,"My doctor said I probably developed it some time while on depo, but the hormonal birth control hid the symptoms since it's typically used to treat them."
14115,She says she's not interested in getting me the treatment where you can remove the growths caused by it (she refuses to believe that's what it is even though I literally have all the symptoms).
14116,"Said it didn't matter either way, because even if I was diagnosed with it, she'd treat it the same way giving me hormonal birth control.I really want to get the copper IUD, but she told me that because it causes heavy bleeding the first few weeks, it would make my symptoms worse (since they get bad during my periods)."
14117,"I was curious if anyone with endometriosis symptoms has ever taken something like birth control pills (only while on their period) and using their copper IUD to stop the painful episodes until your body adjusts?I figured the pill would be good as well, since there are variations of it that have muuuuch lower amounts of hormones than other methods."

14135,I have a consult for sterilization on Monday.
14136,Ive been on birth control since I was 16.
14137,Ive known since I was a little girl that I didnt want babies.
14138,I will not change my mind.
14139,It seems on my list of why to do it I have only pros.
14140,Wondering if anyone has insight/ has had it done and had any adverse reactions.
14141,Everything Im finding on the internet has been positive anecdotes.
14142,Its major surgery and Im trying to be realistic.
14143,What surgery are you asking about specifically?
14144,"Tying tubes, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy?"
14145,Thatll affect the answers
14146,"If your surgery is laparoscopic, it's not really even something I would consider ""major"" (the consequences are major, but the surgery and recovery is generally quick)."
14147,The empowerment of having absolute control over your fertility is generally very emotionally fulfilling.
14148,Major complications are rare.
14149,Just advocate for yourself for pain management.
14150,"I've found that doctors are not that sympathetic to gynecological pain, and I would just make sure that they take your pain management seriously."
14151,"I'm not saying that you'll need a ton or anything, but know your options."
14152,Wont you miss the chance to wipe up human feces on a regular basis?
14153,How will you ever listen to screeching noises?
14154,Who will vomit and drool on all your favorite sweaters?
14155,I had a bisalp last year at 23.
14156,Over a year later and it's the best decision I've ever made.
14157,"A bisalp just removes the tubes, so there's no issues with loss of hormones, which would happen if you removed the ovaries, and you still menstruate."
14158,"If you don't want kids, the only ""con"" of a bisalp is the possibility of any surgery side effects."
14159,But those aren't exactly specific to a bisalp.
14160,Bislap recovery for me is more uncomfortable/painful/longer than I would have hoped for!
14161,Missing probably 810 days of work  losing a lot of independence during this time so those are cons I would say!
14162,But I wouldnt change my decision for a second.
14163,I have EI coverage to help with my time off work  family and friends to help me during my recovery and I never have to worry about birth control or getting pregnant ever again )
14164,That's awesome!
14165,My consult appointment is in a week!
14166,Good luck!

14170,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
14171,"The only thing I can think of if you're doing what I did which is a bi salp, is that you may need to take time off work to recover, depending how fast your body heals, having permanent scars on your belly and the money it may cost."
14172,It cost me a deductible so 1500.
14173,I made payments to the hospital for awhile for that though.
14174,I work from home so I didn't have to take time off.
14175,I also had my partner help with the chores at home and the dogs.
14176,I was pretty sore afterwards so I couldn't bend down.
14177,Idk if any of those variables would affect you though.
14178,It depends on your situation.
14179,"But yeah, cons are also risk of complications post op, getting addicted to the pain meds they prescribed you, and your chores at home may suffer a bit."
14180,"So, scars, money, time off work, needing help after surgery, and you'll need IVF if you change your mind."
14181,At least I think that's what my dr said afterwards.
14182,I can't recall.
14183,I laughed and told her no way I'll never change my mind.
14184,"Otherwise, I can't think of anything else."
14185,"Maybe if you're like me, you hate periods, so you'll want to stay on bc pills to avoid periods."
14186,And that has side effects.
14187,"But yeah, not a lot of cons."
14188,Good luck!
14189,My mother used the essure method at 26 (Having an autistic toddler was a bit too much).
14190,"It gave some people many issues and was retired, but she was 1000 fine, as well as my aunts, that used it too."
14191,Maybe there's something similar already???
14192,?
14193,"You will still need birth control if you have bad periods or cramps, main reason I won't do it unless it's a hysterectomy lol"
14194,The main problem about sterilisation is the premature menopause in the moment you remove ovary.
14195,You can get very bad side effects (you can look up on Google about those and they are true).
14196,I think that since you are already 28 you can wait a few more years before something that drastic.
14197,At 35/36 your chances of getting pregnant get lower and your body is more suitable for something like a sterilisation.
14198,I think that if you have some sort of problems related to your reproductive system you can try to inform your self and get checked by a very good gynaecologist to try to solve any types of discomfort.
14199,Im open to all options!
14200,Im going in thinking I want a bilateral salpingectomy.
14201,Worried about premature hormonal aging though.
14202,This is the advice I came here for.
14203,Theres a ton of misinformation online!
14204,Im worried about my recovery period but Ive never had surgery before!
14205,So to me it is major!
14206,Thank you for your time
14207,Lmao my two cats are plenty enough children for me!
14208,!
14209,How were you able to get it so young?
14210,I've heard that's really hard to do though I'd like to get it done young as well
14211,How did the surgery go?
14212,Could you tell me a little bit more about that?
14213,I'm also trying to get a bisalp.
14214,Hmm thats interesting I was under the impression it would stop my periods!
14215,How is a hysterectomy different?
14216,Im not looking to have any ovaries removed luckily.
14217,Im not sure theyd let me unless it was medically necessary.
14218,Thanks for the insight!
14219,I had a bisalp earlier this year.
14220,Tube removal.
14221,This doesn't involve your hormones.
14222,"I am 1 year post bisalp, no impact to hormones!"
14223,"I just have a really amazing doctor, honestly."
14224,R/childfree has a list of doctors who will perform the surgery with personal experiences.
14225,"Some people have even gotten approved as young as 21, I believe."
14226,I definitely suggest researching a bunch of different doctors in your area.
14227,Really well.
14228,"Minimal pain, no complications, no infection."
14229,Much better than I expected truthfully.
14230,"Check out r/sterilization for more experiences, concerns, or general questions from Redditors."
14231,"No, it only ties or burns off the tubes to prevent sperm reaching an egg."
14232,A hysterectomy removes the whole uterus and just leaves the ovaries
14233,Wonderful!
14234,So no premature menopause?
14235,My doctor said theres a chance of that happening but I may need another doctor (not a man)
14236,A total hysterectomy removes the uterus and cervix.An oophorectomy is a removal of 1 or both of the ovaries.
14237,Doctors won't remove the ovaries unless deemed necessary.
14238,Your ovaries are for hormone production.
14239,Removal will put you into early menopause.
14240,"Your doctor might have been talking about the chance of hormones being affected if a bilateral salpingectomy is done with there is an ectopic pregnancy, which can disrupt the hormone production."
14241,This is a low chance even with an ectopic pregnancy and I never have heard of hormone issues otherwise with a bilateral salpingectomy.
14242,I was hoping to get one down years ago so I researched it a ton then.
14243,I just did a quick search and I can't find anything new to say that has changed.
14244,"If they remove your uterus there is a chance,  but they do not in that procedure"
14245,deleted
14246,That isnt true if only the uterus is removed there is a chance for premature menopause.
14247,I dont believe its true if just the tubes are removed.
14248,"If both your ovaries are removed you are 100 percent guaranteed to go into menopause, not just a chance guaranteed.I had extensive discussions about this with my surgeons when I lost an ovary and tube.If a hysterectomy leaves 1 or both of your ovaries intact, there's a chance that you'll experience the menopause sooner than you would have if you did not have a hysterectomy"
14249,"I took all of my 21 pills everyday on my first pack, but on the 2nd day of my 2nd pack i forgot to take a pill."
14250,Should I take 2 pills today?
14251,And am I still protected?

14256,"Im not due to have it removed yet, I just really really dislike it."
14257,But it was painful and traumatic to have it inserted even with the cervical dilating drugs.
14258,"For those who have had theirs removed, how painful was it compared to having an IUD placed?"
14259,For me it was a breeze to get it removed.
14260,I didnt even feel it.
14261,Placement was terrible though
14262,Its not like getting it inserted.
14263,It felt like nothing for me.
14264,Incomparable.
14265,"Insertion was rough, removal the doctor asked me to give a good cough while she did the tug and it was out with minimal discomfort in a second."
14266,"My insertion and whole experience with my IUD was severely traumatic, the extraction was the only easy part."
14267,For me and it was a small pinch and some light cramping afterwards
14268,Much quicker and less painful than insertion.
14269,Not had it myself but use to assist with insertions/removals.
14270,"Most woman I've asked compare it to pulling a tampon out sort of sensation, a bit odd but nothing outrageous."
14271,I know at least one of my friends who pulled hers out by accident!
14272,For me it was super quick and easy.
14273,Didn't feel much.I didn't have any drugs when they inserted it but it was night and day for me.
14274,"(Honestly the cervical numbing shot I got for my Essure was more traumatic for me than either the original IUD insertion OR the removal of the IUD, because it made my heart race and that freaked me out."
14275,YMMV.)
14276,Mine was painful but only because the arm broke off.
14277,Doctor said it was the 3rd time in her 20 years of practice so I'm special lol
14278,My insertion was very traumatic but the removal was quick and painless!
14279,I felt more pain from the speculum insertion than I did the removal itself.
14280,"mine was slightly uncomfortable only because they had to take a tool up to find it because my strings had got sucked inside, but the tool was the painful part."
14281,It being pulled out didnt hurt
14282,My insertion and removal were basically painless!
14283,All around great experience
14284,"After my gyn inserted the speculum, I texted my boyfriend ""He's taking it out now""."
14285,"My doctor was done before I managed to hit send.Pain wise for me was around the same as getting a vaccine, maybe slightly more uncomfortable because I was so nervous and uncomfortable due to the traumatic insertion."
14286,It hurt for me.
14287,It was a shock pain rather than full blown pain.
14288,It made me jump and almost kick my GP in the face.
14289,It hurt and made me bleed for a few days but my skin is very fragile so that wasn't surprising.
14290,It was cramping as well.
14291,It's an odd feeling and I think the noise made me jump as well.
14292,I have removed 2 on myself completely painless for me.

14297,Im the odd one out removal  replacement was more painful than original.
14298,After reading all comments here Id thought itd be a breeze and it was not.
14299,Hopefully for you it is!
14300,"Cough, slight pinch, and it was over."
14301,It was a million times less painful than the insertion and I had instant pain relief after having it out.
14302,Best decision Ive made was to get it out.
14303,Far less painful than the insertion!
14304,"I was braced for something awful, for me it was 1020 of the pain of having it inserted/digging into my fibroid (why I had it removed)"
14305,I felt nothing at all.
14306,Inserting speculum felt like something
14307,It was very easy to take out.
14308,"If you're nervous about pain, my doctor prescribed me tramadol (like a stronger ibuprofen) and that helped a lot."
14309,One cough and its out!
14310,"i had mine removed a few months ago after only having it for a while (due to it perforating my uterus) so because it was perforated the removal was probably a little more painful that it is normally, but it was still a breeze!"
14311,"just a quick ""ow"" and then its over, unlike the insertion pain which went on for a while!"
14312,maybe a bit of cramping after but nothing major
14313,I got my removed recently because I was tired of it.
14314,Removal was a breeze.
14315,It was maybe 10 seconds of cramping.
14316,I'm one of those people that has VERY traumatic IUD inserts.
14317,My first one was so bad I punched the wall and dented it.
14318,The second one I couldn't even get through them dilating my cervix to measure my uterus.
14319,Had to have it inserted under sedation.
14320,Getting it taken out was dead easy.
14321,Sharp pinch and done.
14322,"Less uncomfortable than a cervical swap, and takes a fraction of the time."
14323,Mine was painful to remove.
14324,It reminded me briefly of the insertion pain but its over in seconds.
14325,It made me jump.
14326,"For me it was followed by some deep cramps and then I felt like my cervix was sore, but its not as bad as the insertion I promise."
14327,Its way faster and the pain lasts way less.
14328,You can do this and you will do great!
14329,You can always try to request an anti anxiety medication for removal to help ease your mind.
14330,Sometimes stress makes it worse
14331,Didnt hurt at all!
14332,Really quick pinch and done.
14333,Super easy and way easier getting it out then in.
14334,Getting it inserted was 10/10 pain for me and i have a pretty high tolerance.
14335,Getting it out felt like a walk in the park
14336,For me removal was much worse.
14337,I cramped really bad and it took a while to subside.
14338,But I was probably dehydrated
14339,"My insertion was really really horrible, but my removal was painless."
14340,"Super easy, just slightly uncomfortable."
14341,"I've done two removals now, both were disconcertingly easy."
14342,Small cramp and done.
14343,better than insertion by a trillion light years just dont think too much about it
14344,Mine hurt extremely bad.
14345,But mine had also come loose inside of me.
14346,It was some of the excruciating pain Ive had.
14347,"I got another reinserted, and the same thing happened."
14348,Gyno said my body rejects the iud I ended up getting nexplanon.
14349,"The pain was way less, and Ive had no problems at all, except I am waiting for the spotting to stop, which is slightly annoying."
14350,My removal wasnt bad at all!
14351,"I could definitely feel it coming out, but I wouldnt describe it as painful."
14352,Just a weird feeling.
14353,I got a removal and new insertion back to back!
14354,I was nervous that when taking the copper iud out it would scrape bc Ive seen those tiktok videos  BUT it was less than a period cramp for 2 seconds.
14355,Insertion after she had to hold it in place for 510 seconds and felt horrible cramps but as soon as speculum was out they stopped!!
14356,!
14357,"I got laughing gas when I got mine removed, so it was the best time of my life."
14358,Felt nothing but euphoria.
14359,Experience is different from person to person.
14360,"For me, I didnt even feel it and Ive had an IUD removed 2 times (both times were because my uterus rejected the Kyleena IUD and I currently have Mirena with no issues)."
14361,Ive had friends who said they nearly fainted.
14362,My advice would be to take tylenol before.
14363,It wont be painless but it will definitely reduce it some
14364,Nothing like insertion  insertion was traumatic lolRemoval just felt like a quick cramp and a pinch and was over super fast.
14365,"In fact, I remember saying wow thats it?Youll be okay"
14366,I literally didn't even realise it had been taken out when my doctor did it.
14367,I felt nothing.
14368,Just got mine removed last Saturday and it felt like a bad period cramp that lasted a few mins.
14369,Nothing compared to insertion
14370,"I also hated my IUD, but was super nervous to have it taken out because I had literally NO idea what it felt like!"
14371,"Yikes!But she just put the speculum in, said ""cough on the count of three"", and I barely felt anything."
14372,It was over in literally less than one second.
14373,"I was more confused about how fast it was than anything lol.I had some light cramps/spotting afterwards, but not even comparable to the cramps/bleeding after insertion."
14374,Mine was halfway out and getting it taken out caused me to cramp severely for about 10 minutes before I was good enough to drive home.
14375,I'd reccomend taking something beforehand and you'll be fine.
14376,For perspective my insertion was awful even when sedated and left me bed ridden for 3 days.
14377,Its a 3/10 on the pain scale and lasts a for literally a second.
14378,Its so biggy and considering what a great option it is those few seconds of pain are 10000 worth it.
14379,My first removal was awful BUT that was because the np who put in it cut my string so short that it was impossible to remove by pulling the string.
14380,sadly the MD I was seeing at the time had to take tools to go up into my cervix to grab the base of the IUD and pull it own.
14381,The pulling was fine it was just the digging for it that sucked badly.
14382,He definitely tried to go quickly to have to over with.
14383,He put in the new one after that and I barley even noticed.
14384,"That being said, the second time I got it removed it felt like nothing."
14385,Not even a cramp.
14386,Next time I get an IUD again Im making sure Im having someone experienced do it.
14387,Just wondering but when did you taking the drug?
14388,I've had 3 IUDs and was always told to take 2 hours before appointment.
14389,When I took it that way the 3rd IUD (rather than reading the label plus I had it for weeks and forgot what she verbally said because she said too many things for my squirrel brain at once) she almost cancelled and wanted me to come back because I was supposed to take 1012 hours prior and advil 2 hours before appointment.
14390,So me personally idk how it should feel at this point.
14391,It has always hurt/been uncomfortable but I could withstand it without crying or anything.
14392,The 3rd time hurt the worst but I had on and off cramping multiple times a month because the previous doctor I saw for weird cramping and bleeding a few months prior told me my IUD was good for two more years when it had actually expired a year ago.
14393,"No problems since getting it replaced As far as IUD vs implant, the implant didn't work and my bleeding was ongoing after a month so we removed it and that was when I first got an IUD."
14394,Placement was really horrible for me too.
14395,Removal was just a short pain that was gone in an instant and it was more of a shock for me than anything else.
14396,You'll be fine!
14397,Horrific.
14398,They tell you to cough and literally yank it out.
14399,I asked if they were joking.
14400,My cramping lasted a couple weeks.
14401,I will never get another IUD because of how hellish insertion was.
14402,"Removal wasn't in the same hemisphere.Let me put it this way, I would go through the removal a hundred times over if it meant I never had to have a simple hang nail again."
14403,"It's not even painful, just odd."
14404,"Even then it only lasts for a second and then it's over, I asked her if there was an issue because I didn't think she had done it."
14405,Nothing compared to insertion.
14406,Theres usually a few minor cramps but once its out its a fairly easy recovery.
14407,A breeze!
14408,"No pain, no nothing."
14409,I was told to cough and I didnt even know he pulled it out
14410,I didn't feel my gyno take it out.
14411,"I was waiting for pain, and then she said, ""Here's your little friend,"" with it dangling from her hand."
14412,"Insertion was an 8/10, removal wasn't even a 1/10."
14413,It was literally 2 seconds of a weird cramp and then nothing.
14414,I hope you have a similar experience!
14415,Honestly insertion was a total nightmare.
14416,Apparently I scared an entire waiting room full of other women.
14417,And I'm pretty sure she gave me a placebo Vicodin because I felt absolutely everything still and I was not calmed down at all.
14418,Having it taken out was a quicker experience but it hurt so much and I'm just glad that it's over and done with.
14419,I envy the woman that can live with an IUD.
14420,"I've had two removed, both painless."
14421,Feels like a minor cramp.
14422,I literally felt nothing during removal.
14423,Nothing like insertion.
14424,Don't be nervous.
14425,It truly was quick and literally painless.
14426,No pain.
14427,Similar sensation to removing a tampon.
14428,I second this!
14429,It made me jump too!!
14430,!
14431,"Replacement, as in removal and the insertion of a new one, if I understand you correctly ?"
14432,"Not JUST removal?Of course that's gonna suck, but not because of the removal part."
14433,"I thought the same thing, but I found the removal and replacement super painful too."
14434,I like yelped when my obgyn pulled the old one out and wasn't expecting that to hurt.
14435,Literally thought I'd have to come back for the insertion another day (I didn't and she gave me the pain blocker thing in my cervix for the insertion  but it still hurt like hell lol).
14436,"That said, insertion is definitely worse than removal, the pain and cramping from removal subsided in like 12 minutes."
14437,Im getting mine out soon after 3 years and this is what Im so afraid of.
14438,Getting it in sent me deep sharp cramps so painful that they had to do an ultrasound to make sure it didnt perforate my uterus.
14439,Im terrified to get it out.
14440,The removal also sucked.
14441,I thought itd be easy and it had me screaming.
14442,Hey so I did get mine out this past February!
14443,I was very scared because my insertion pain was so bad.
14444,"I wont lie to you, it did hurt having it come out, but it isnt nearly as bad as the insertion!"
14445,"The initial pain is for just a few seconds, then followed by some deep cramping that went away quickly too"
14446,Thank you so much for the encouragement!
14447,Of course!
14448,You got this!
14449,It will be over within moments.
14450,Way faster than the insertion.
14451,Previously as a teen I used combo pills but they gave me awful leg cramps and migraines.
14452,This resulted in switching to paragards but unfortunately my 1st and now my 2nd one got expelled after many years (14 combined).
14453,After being off hormonal pills I've been diagnosed with migraines so that side effect may be unrelated.I'm now considering if mini pills or other types or hormonal birth control pills will work better now that I'm in my 30s.
14454,"Can you ""grow"" out of the side effects?"
14455,Would the minipill still be a cause for leg cramping?
14456,I'm seeing a doctor in the next few weeks but would love to hear anyone's experience!

14487,"Ive been on my pill for less than a month, and Im on the last 3rd week pill."
14488,I did have unprotected sex about 5 days ago and just alittle history I havent had my period for about  170 days before starting about 3 weeks ago.
14489,Ive been through test and ultrasounds and my doctor didnt find anything that stuck out to her as a problem so she just prescribed me some BC pills to regulate my period.
14490,"Ive always been irregular, ever since Ive gotten my period."
14491,My mom has also had irregular periods too growing up so idk maybe that could contribute to why I have them too.
14492,"Anyways, the discharge that is coming out is like dark brown, and Im scared its implantation bleeding.. or it could just be old blood because I havent had my period for so long but today is the heaviest its ever been so far."
14493,Idk if youve ever experienced this please help!

14499,Hi!
14500,I have a question that feels obvious but I just want to know if anyone has had similar experience.
14501,I had a copper IUD for 4 years.
14502,"My experience was awesome with no side effects, insertion and removal were basically painless, all around great."
14503,"I got it out 5 months ago to start trying for a baby, with no luck initially, we stopped trying 2 months ago because I need to have an unrelated surgery so we are pausing and will try again after surgery."
14504,"Since removal my period has been shorter than when I had my IUD (with IUD my periods were regular, used regular tampons for bleeding and about 6 days long) Post IUD the first month was only 4 days, second month 3 days, third month 2 days, 4th month 2 days and now I am 5 days late with Negative pregnancy test."
14505,My husband and I also used protection this month and didnt have sex around ovulation so I really doubt I could be pregnant.
14506,"I am just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience with their periods getting so light and short after, and what you did about it?"
14507,Thanks!

14513,I didnt know this.
14514,Is there anyone here whos gotten pregnant after having one?
14515,"I got pregnant with the copper IUD _in place._  IUDs don't affect fertility unless you experience embedment, perforation, or PID/endomitritis that leave a significant amount of scaring."
14516,This is not unique to copper IUDs it is a risk with all IUDs.
14517,pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis Some IUS users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis.
14518,PID and endometritis are usually sexually transmitted.
14519,You have a higher chance of getting PID and endometritis if you or your partner has sex with other partners.
14520,"PID and endometritis can cause serious problems such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and pelvic pain that does not go away."
14521,PID and endometritis are usually treated with antibiotics.
14522,More serious cases of PID or endometritis may require surgery.

14539,i recently moved across the country and im getting my copper iud out in two weeks.
14540,"getting it put in was so bad i threw up and couldnt walk, im so so scared to be doing this alone."
14541,i havent had any bad cramping since getting it put in so i dont think it has embedded into my uterine wall or anything crazy but its been 5 years and i didnt get it checked on once and im just so scared
14542,You wont feel anything when they remove it
14543,Removal is literally easy.
14544,I had a horrible insertion with Mirena and was terrified of getting the removal.
14545,"Removal was 5 seconds and it barely even hurt, she had me cough and it was out, I had some spotting after but I was completely fine after."

14551,"Some people have said they feel a pinch, but as long as its not embedded you should have significantly less pain getting it out than you felt during insertion."
14552,Good luck!
14553,Mine came out hooked to a tampon and I didnt even realize it til I saw it on there
14554,thank you
14555,thank you so much.
14556,im literally here in bed crying like why did i wait to do this for when i was across the country alone ive got no clue
14557,ah thank you so much
14558,HA that give me a giggle thank u
14559,"I completely understand, I was terrified."
14560,I made my husband go with me because I was so terrified.
14561,But it was so simple and luckily my doctor did hear my reservations about it before and kinda calmed me down.
14562,"Take deep breaths prior to the appointment is the best I can say, helps my anxiety for the most part."
14563,Sending you all the hugs and best vibes I can.
14564,i just went to planned parenthood to get it out because i couldnt wait any longer AND IT WENT SO WELL!!!
14565,so easy and everyone was so nice i dont even have cramps and i can tell a difference in how my body feels already its crazy.
14566,Also apparently it was already HALFWAY OUT and i couldve gotten pregnant.
14567,"Thank you for the good vibes, today is a good day"
14568,Oh my!
14569,Well I'm glad you got it out and it went smoothly for you.
14570,I noticed an instant difference plus my major anxiety that I had with the Mirena went way down later in that week.
14571,Hello all!
14572,Im a 22 yr old who has gone on and off nuva ring since I was about 16.
14573,Ive used it consistently for the once a month replacement method (rather than taking it out for four or seven days) for about a year now.
14574,"Im experiencing side effects that range from definitely the ring (cramps after orgasm, moodiness/rigidness) to maybe the ring (gained 25ish pounds in the year Ive been on it, extra greasy hair) and Im starting to ask if its worth it?"
14575,"Sure, that main point of not getting pregnant and helping with acne is great, and no period blood 90 of the time is a nice bonus."
14576,But vs all the cons Ive listed plus some I may have not have even noticed yet?
14577,Should I just ditch birth control and stick with condoms?
14578,Or at least do a trial of it?
14579,"Have permission from doc to do a trial for a few months, but wondered other womens opinions and experiences ) TIA!"

14584,I (22F) had never used bc I knew both of my parents were carriers of a genetic disorder called factor v leiden.
14585,I did some blood tests and found out 2020 that I am heterozygous for factor v mutation (which is good!).
14586,I decided to get a copper IUD in Jan 2021 as it has no hormones and wouldnt affect clotting.
14587,The first year I dealt with heavy bleeding and cramps but it was normal compared to what Im dealing with now.
14588,"About 67 months ago, my periods started lasting 2 weeks, often beginning and ending with 5 days of brown blood (which can be old oxidized blood?)."
14589,"I was scheduled for a pap smear in June, but my gynecologist wanted me to get a vaginal ultrasound first instead."
14590,Found out after that and labs that my testosterone levels are high and I have over 60 follicles/cysts on my ovaries PCOS!
14591,A month later we took out the copper and put in a kyleena IUD to help stop bleeding.
14592,My obgyn let me know that the synthetic progestin stays concentrated in my uterus and shouldnt get into my blood stream.
14593,Its been about 7 weeks now since Ive gotten kyleena and I was on my period during  710 more days bleeding after insertion.
14594,Around the last week of august I started getting dark brown stringy discharge which lasted up until 5 days ago I started bleeding/ still kinda mixed with brown.
14595,I have now stopped bleeding and have a lighter brown still dark discharge.
14596,Still stringy (I figured now my uterus lining is shedding from the progesterone) but I just cant do it any more with the brown poopy discharge all the time.
14597,It just wont end

14602,"I've (26F) been on three rounds of different BC (first two were combination pills, current one is Kyleena IUD) and I changed the first ones because of bulging veins and swelling, along with pain in legs including varicose veins."
14603,I stopped the second time because a vein bulged out really ugly on my right wrist.
14604,It hurt and itched like crazy.I've been to two gynecologists that both don't think it's related.
14605,I only experience this while on BC...
14606,I'm starting to experience these vein related issues again on my IUD.
14607,Am I crazy?
14608,I want to remove my IUD now because it has me concerned.
14609,"I need to keep my hands and feet elevated because if not my veins bulge and apart from not looking good, they feel heavy."
14610,They do go down if I elevate them.
14611,I'm also having varicose vein isssues again and strong beating sensations randomly throughout my legs that last a few seconds.
14612,"On the combination pill, I had other symptoms that made me think I had vasculitis."
14613,They did go away after a month when I stopped taking the pill.
14614,I wanted to like the IUD and I was told the hormones are localized...I'm so exhausted!
14615,I would appreciate any insights even if it's saying it might not be related.
14616,Thank you for reading if you got to here!
14617,I'd like to know this too.
14618,"My veins are much more prominent, and I have spider veins on my legs now whereas I didn't before."
14619,"I can't have estrogen or an IUD so idk about how that would effect me, but I have nexplanon."
14620,"Even family members have commented on how they remember my veins ""looking different""."
14621,"Cardiovascular issues run heavy in my family, and I already have a heart condition, so I don't really take this side effect lightly."
14622,"I honestly just might get rid of the nexplanon and go back to condoms  I've also been experiencing dizziness and headaches.It's weird because progesterone only birth control isn't supposed to cause anything cardiovascular related, but I've talked to many people who have had weird vein related effects while being on it."
14623,"think it's probably something that hasn't been studied closely, and so they don't really know why it happens or who it might happen to."
14624,"The good news is I don't think it will raise your risk of blood clots, because it's been well studied that progesterone only forms of birth control don't have the same risk for that as combination forms."
14625,But that doesn't mean that circulation issues are something to take lightly.

14634,I totally think its related to bc.
14635,"I took slynd, a progestin only pill, for two months, I noticed a ton of spider veins, popping up on my legs and even on my chest."
14636,"My OB/GYN also said she didnt think it was due to the birth control, but this only started after I started the pill."
14637,i think so.
14638,ive been on the combo pill for 5 years and now my veins are extremely prominent everywhere and i even see a few vericose veins.
14639,i thought my skin was thinning out but im only 23 so i think its the pill
14640,"just had my mirena inserted and the pain was indescribableto note, i never had a child and i took like 3 midols beforehand."
14641,i also very rarely have sex.
14642,idk yall this was just my little experience that i wanted to share  but the iud insertion pain is really like no other it was a sharp pain a total of three times.
14643,"the first time was when the cervix opened up, the NP told me to cough which i did and oof it wasnt too bad but it was felt for sure.the second time was when she measured my shit."
14644,"the thing was not getting past 3 cm or whatever  but once my body opened up, she got it to like 7 and omg i felt that one."
14645,it was like a sharp pain but more up my body then where a period cramp would be.
14646,"this lasted for like 3 secondsthe third time was with the iud insertion which felt similar to the measuring, almost about the same actually."
14647,this was like 2 seconds at most.
14648,i legit just got it placed like an hour ago so im still going through the works.
14649,its my cycle right now and im on the first day so i have cramps from that but i can say that my period cramps are definitely more dull than my iud cramps.
14650,the iud ones right now is like a sharper cramp that is more upwards than my period cramps if that makes sense.
14651,im not nauseated or anything and i did not cry during insertion but i def think local anesthesia should be common for this type of thing.
14652,"the poop after insertion was amazing tho.wanted to update for anybody looking through reddit internet searches about the mirena like i was, its day 2 and i feel completely fine."
14653,i have very mild period cramps but havent bled much (just brown discharge).
14654,my mood feels more positive and havent noticed any acne changes or anything.
14655,I agree.
14656,"I heard tons of stories about insertion being painless, and tons mentioning the pain."
14657,No way of knowing how Id react.

14660,I had to take public transportation home.

14686,"I've never taken birth control before, so im a complete idiot on this topic."
14687,"There are some methods that are better suited to it like continuous use combo pills, progestin only pills, depo shot, and hormonal IUDs."
14688,"But ultimately it is just how your body interacts with those methods, it doesn't work for everyone."
14689,"Keep in mind most of the time it will take several months to see a significant reduction, so don't give up too soon if you are still bleeding."
14690,"For example studies show about 68 stop bleeding by 6 months with continuous combo pills, but 88 by 12 months."
14691,Here( is the article I got those numbers from and the chart has stats for many other methods as well but it is more written for medical professionals and might be a bit technical just FYI.

14693,Slynd stopped my periods altogether.
14694,When taken as prescribed I don't get withdrawal bleeding either
14695,Im not sure but my gynecologist has been really good and suggested specific pills for me.
14696,Ask your doctor about it when you go in to request it.
14697,I think it can depend on the person.
14698,Ive never been able to stop my period with any birth control and I've tried 3 different kinds.
14699,You don't get a period on any hormonal birth control.
14700,"On the pill, patch, and ring you will get a withdrawal bleed."
14701,"It's from your body suddenly not getting the hormones, which causes a shed.On continuing methods (depo,IUD,implant), there is no drop in hormones so no withdrawal bleed."
14702,"You can get spotting, but that's from an unstable lining."

14707,Merina iud completely stopped mine
14708,I take a combo pill Lo Lo estrin and havent had a period in years.
14709,I get very light spotting every few months and thats it.
14710,Its awesome.
14711,Someone else mentioned above but the bleeding you get on birth control isnt from your natural cycle.
14712,Its triggered by taking placebo pills you dont ovulate/ menstruate when on birth control other then non hormonal copper IUD.
14713,i was in your boat and im sure my experience is not the experience of everyone else but im currently coming off of a period stopping birth control.
14714,"it was fun when i was on it, but now that im coming off, my body is making up for all the uterine shredding it didnt do."
14715,ive been having a non stop period for 3 months.
14716,theres no telling when it will end.
14717,im miserable.
14718,i wish i had never done it in the first place.
14719,"With options like the implant and IUD, the longer you have it in, sometimes you will stop getting your period."
14720,"I will add though that this is not a true period and this goes for all types of hormonal birth control (pill, iud, patch, implant, etc.)."
14721,The bleeding that occurs is withdrawal bleeding.
14722,It looks and feels like a period but its not actually a true one.
14723,"I got Mirena placed in a little over a year ago but still get my period, however it has gotten a lot lighter."
14724,I have other friends who stopped getting it a few months in.
14725,Just depends from person to person
14726,Thank you very much for that.
14727,The combo pills sound great
14728,Thank you so so much for the detailed answer!
14729,I didn't know birth control pills could get rid of periods too.
14730,that would be my preference then!
14731,I have been on many combo pills and movisse (mini pill) and Slynd (also a mini pill) is the first and ONLY PILL that has ever in my entire 34 years that has let me skip a period!!!
14732,I had to take pregnancy tests to make sure it was for real lol!
14733,I have only been on it 4 months so far but it is like the best thing ever!
14734,Please note this varies.
14735,"Some people experience excessive bleeding from birth control, or it does not impact their bleeding at all."
14736,This is common with menstrual disorders Family history of birth control be helpful.
14737,"If other family members have tried a form or brand, you may have a similar reaction."
14738,"So one that helps them may help OP, ones that didnt may not"
14739,"Wow, I had no idea."
14740,So the withdrawal bleed is just a one time thing that happens when you start?
14741,"I started one called Simpesse which is levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol, which is meant to reduce periods to once every three months, I'm liking it so far."
14742,deleted
14743,Ive been on 5 combo pills and the traditional minipill (norethindrone) and have never been able to skip/lose my period.
14744,I recently found out my insurance covers Slynd so Im about to try ityoure giving me hope!
14745,"no, birth control pills come with a week of placebo pills that dont have any hormones, you just take them to keep yourself in the habit basically but your body bleeds from withdrawal from the pills that do contain hormones."
14746,"Oh, okie!"
14747,That makes perfect sense.
14748,"im not gonna keep asking a million questions, but im curious, what is the point of the weekly dose of placebo pills at the end of the pill regime?"
14749,"like, whats the original purpose for that exactly??"
14750,im just confused why that would even exist?
14751,"Just to say, it's not guaranteed to always skip your period."
14752,I used a combo pill for 6 years.
14753,Back then you were told it was bad for you to skip to the placebo week.
14754,That you had to have a period.
14755,So it was a while before I experimented but after a couple years I started skipping.
14756,The longest I got at a time was 3 months.
14757,"Then it didn't matter if I skipped the placebo, period was coming regardless."
14758,Every time.
14759,"So just to be clear, it might take your periods away entirely, it might only skip them for a few months, or like someone else said you could experience break through (spotting) bleeding occasionally, or more times!"
14760,Nothing is guaranteed.
14761,The placebo pills are just there to keep you in the habit of taking a daily pill.
14762,Nothing more.
14763,deleted
14764,"I just want to add, the other reason the placebo break is included is because tons of us have breakthrough bleeding if we don't just go ahead and allow a bleed monthly (or every few months)."
14765,The lining becomes unstable over time.
14766,"Scheduled, short, controlled bleeding is preferable to random, unpredictable, frequent bleeding LOL.I think a lot of people have this misconception that the placebos are included as this archaic relic of how women's health used to be viewed (and it certainly started that way), but I believe they continue to be included even in modern day for reasons I stated above.That's why we have more options now with this in mind such as quarterly period pills, pills with only 4 break days, etc."
14767,"It's not 'medically necessary' to have a period but many people struggle to skip them entirely, unfortunately."
14768,hi.
14769,i was put on bc (pills) for my pcos and i was wondering when do i start on the pills again because i am currently on my period (day 2) and is it normal to have intense cramps after starting bc for the first period?

14774,Im not really following your questionI think the parts I am following depends on what pill you are on.
14775,combined pill (the brand im using is microgynon 30)
14776,Typical use is take for 21 days and then stop for 7 and repeat.
14777,There is no normal responses.
14778,Everyone is unique in how they respond.
14779,But after a couple of months symptoms should balance out and not be problematic or you may want to try a different pill.
14780,"Hi there, I have pcos, hypothyroidism, insulin resistance, irregular periods and had alopecia areata in the past."
14781,I currently take Metformin and Levoxyl to manage everything and so far they both have worked.
14782,"However, I have been told multiple times by drs that I should go on birth control but Im too nervous to start because of the side effects."
14783,My question is are there any pills out there that dont cause hair loss and weight gain as I dont wanna risk going through that again and Im not comfortable with the other BC methods.

14788,"I have had so many tests done and seen so many different specialists, so the absolute last thing I can think is that my Kyleena IUD is causing my issues."
14789,I came here to see if anyone has experienced anything similar?
14790,So I got my Kyleena in February of last year.
14791,"I've had a Mirena before for 5 years, then about a year and a half on the pill before getting the new IUD."
14792,"I picked Kyleena because it has less hormones than Mirena, but still enough to help with endo symptoms."
14793,"My period has been fine on it, very light and short lasting."
14794,"What I'm here to ask about is this maybe 6 months or so after I got it put in, I started having episodes of presyncope."
14795,"If you aren't familiar with that, it's the feelings that happen right before you pass out (syncope), only it would last for very extended periods."
14796,Several hours in some cases.
14797,"This went on on and off for a few months, and then in November, something changed."
14798,"Ever since midNovember, I have been dealing with constant (literally constant, it does not stop for one single second, not one breath) vertigo, faintness, and weakness."
14799,"Some nights, falling asleep is difficult because I keep feeling like I'm falling, and it's jarring."
14800,"The presyncope episodes have calmed down mostly, but I am never ""normal"" anymore."
14801,"My new baseline is ""dizzy"" pretty much."
14802,I have noticed that my symptoms are consistently worse in the couple days before my period starts each month.
14803,I don't know if it's possible for this to be caused by an IUD.
14804,I don't know anything.
14805,"I've just been to hospital after hospital for nearly a year now, and have been given no answers at all, and the fact that the symptoms flare up more around my cycle makes me wonder if it's happening because of the Kyleena."
14806,"I know dizziness is a possible side effect, but permanent dizziness and nearfainting?"
14807,Please let me know if any of you have experienced anything like this at all.

14812,I got a call from the doctor to stop taking birth control because I have a liver problem and I need to talk to my gastroenterologist about if I can start birth control with estrogen.
14813,I have a fatty liver and I was told that the only thing I could do is lose weight.
14814,"I've lost 70 lbs, maybe he should take another look at my liver?"
14815,Has anyone with liver issues ever heard this about birth control?

14819,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
14820,"My fatty liver got better with time, but I wasn't ever barred from birth control because of it."
14821,"Well, maybe in my case it was because I was already barred from estrogen containing ones once I realized I have painless migraine with aura."
14822,They never really mentioned that or talked about it with me.
14823,I'd definitely recommend a second look at your liver.
14824,"Mine happened when I was really skinny, I gained weight since being diagnosed, and it's actually better than it has been in years all because I changed my horrible diet."
14825,"At my last CT scan of it, it was actually normal."
14826,"And I'm on birth control right now (nexplanon), and I wasn't when I was originally diagnosed."
14827,"So yeah, I'd definitely get another opinion."
14828,"If you recover from fatty liver you should be able to take estrogen unless estrogen birth control is the cause, which is really rare."
14829,"At the very least you should be allowed to take progesterone only methods, which I was never told I couldn't take and didn't hurt my liver at all."
14830,Just a dumb little rant cuz I'm just tired of everything.
14831,"I was on the depo shot for 3 years, came off because it made my sex drive die to the point that sex seemed disgusting and made my depression 10 times worse."
14832,"Was off everything for a while, then went to the combo pill."
14833,Developed horrible migraines and chest pains.
14834,Went to the mini pill.
14835,That stressed me out too much with how touchy it was and how I had to take it at the exact same time and all the stories of how it wasn't as effective as other methods.
14836,"Now I'm on nexplanon, been on it for just over a month and I have never had worse gut problems in my life."
14837,And all the spotting and mood swings on top of that.
14838,I just don't know what to do.
14839,May last two options I feel are the IUDs because if the estrogen messed me up on the pill I feel like I should avoid things with estrogen in them.
14840,But I don't really want either of the IUDs lol.
14841,It's such an invasive process and I've had bad experiences with other proceedures done in the same area and I really don't want that.
14842,"But even if I could get past that, the copper iud sounds bad because off birth control my periods were awful."
14843,"Horrid cramps, bleeding enough to fill a menstral cup in two to three hours on the first days and the thought of the copper wire breaking upon removal sounds horrible."
14844,And the hormonal iud still uses similar hormones to everything else I've tried.
14845,And then there's the eptopic pregnancy scare if I were to get pregnant on it just UGH.
14846,"My mood has just been all over the place, I've been having hard time focusing on anything and I'm just so tired."
14847,If I knew for a 100 fact my husband and I didn't want kids I would sterilize myself.
14848,This all just sucks ass
14849,"Lots of people have shared your experiences, including me, so I feel you."
14850,Im sorry youve been going through this.
14851,"I have bad pregnancy anxiety but my partner and I only use condoms and usually I make him pull out as well, and we havent had any scares at all."
14852,"I can no longer put hormones in my body as they make my anxiety and depression worse, as well as other side effects."
14853,Maybe you could try just condoms?
14854,I agree with the other commenter that condoms ( keeping a Plan B handy) is a great option.
14855,I did that for many years because I have such a hard time with hormonal methods.One thing I did want to explore a little more  Your only problem with the minipill was the super short window to take it and the efficacy concerns.
14856,Do you have an option like Slynd available to you?
14857,It's a minipill with the same 24hour window as combo pills and it reliably stops ovulation just like combo pills.
14858,"But without the estrogen.Might be something to look into before you, justifiably, throw in the towel."
14859,Good luck OP!
14860,"Just a note, some side effects can be due to the type of progestin rather than the estrogen."
14861,"I would look up the progestin in your old pill, see how androgenic it is, and try a progestin with different properties."
14862,Or Slynd as others have mentioned
14863,Nice birth control that is not hormonal and is not interuptive during sex can be difficult.
14864,I didn't like the pill but only tried one kind but am pretty sure that hormonal bc is not the way for me.
14865,And a copper IUD is also not for me.
14866,I like using condoms but condoms are just not working for my current bf and I.
14867,"Well, at least not the male condom."
14868,There are female condoms but they look a bit strange to me and are rather expensive in my area.
14869,My bf and I currently use Caya diaphragm with Caya gel and it's gone pretty well.
14870,I like that I can insert this up to 2 hours before sex so it's not like with condoms that you have to focus on it right before penetration.
14871,It just makes it much smoother.
14872,I'm not worried about STD's so for me this is a good option.
14873,Only thing is that you need to keep it in for at least 6 hours after ejaculation and up to a max of 24 hours.
14874,"The 6 hours is not that difficult for me if we have sex at night, but if we have it in the morning, then I need to calculate lol."
14875,I find it easiest to just put an alarm in my phone when I go to the bathroom to pee after sex.
14876,That way I'm not taking it out a bit too early.
14877,"This is just my personal experience, and since you've said that similar procedures in the same area have been painful, take it with a grain of salt."
14878,But I love my copper IUD.
14879,I took 800 mg of Ibuprofen about an hour before my appointment and didn't feel a thing.
14880,"Yes, my periods for the next year or so were heavier, but my bf and I use no other forms of birth control and I haven't had a single issue.However."
14881,"If it is causing you THIS much stress and physical issues, consider pregnancywould the physical toll be worth it?"
14882,"Not only does your body change during pregnancy, but it will never be the same after."
14883,"Are you truly willing to face even more issues after bringing a child into the world, down the line?"
14884,"Or would your plan be to have a child someday and then get sterilized after?Unfortunately, reproductive care for women is ages behind where it should be, and most doctors still only know a few options."
14885,I'd think long and hard and have a discussion with your partner.
14886,"Hormones don't work, an IUD might not be possible for your anatomy, and he doesn't like condoms."
14887,So is keeping your fertility intact really worth all this pain and misery?
14888,"It sounds like, from your post, you're still undecided on that."
14889,But I urge you to consider the ways that your quality of life might improve if you simply get sterilized.
14890,"There are so many other methods for bringing children into your life these days, and to be honest, you might be a better parent in the future if you aren't dealing with horrible periods every month."
14891,"Plus, pregnancy brings it's own risks and is extremely expensive (at least in the USA)."
14892,"Other methods are also pricey, but they do not come with the risks to your mental and physical health that might be a problem if you're already experiencing so many uterusrelated problems."
14893,I went with nexplanon for 7 years.
14894,"Not sure what it is now but back then it was only good for 3 years, so I liked it enough that I got 2 new ones inserted."
14895,"That said, the first few months SUCKED."
14896,I think I spotted for about 4 months which drove me nuts but one day it just stopped and I didnt have any symptoms whatsoever.
14897,It was about halfway through my second that my spotting came back and it was nonstop.
14898,My doctor put me on the pill on top of it to stop the spotting which just seemed ridiculous but I was desperate.
14899,"Thinking it had gone bad, I got my new one inserted a few months early and left it about a year before realizing maybe nexplanon just wasnt working for me anymore."
14900,"After that I switched to nuvaring for 3 months and then landed on the IUD, which I now also hate and am planning on switching to just au naturale cycle tracking lol."
14901,I guess my point is maybe try to stick it out through the spotting and see if its worth it to you after all the bs.
14902,"At the end of the day, no birth control is perfect and our bodies will eventually grow resistant to it, as with any medication."
14903,Its a bunch of trial and error and picking which one sucks the least.
14904,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.

14907,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
14908,I feel you because I'm in a similar place.
14909,I can't use estrogen based methods because I get migraines with aura.
14910,I had a skyla IUD for a couple years a long while back but the pain was intense so I don't want another IUD.
14911,"Was on the mini pill for a bit but also didn't like the 15min window and it gave me daily headaches (this was before slynd so maybe it'd be different with slynd, but I specifically need to stop progestogens)."
14912,"Then I got a nexplanon, kept the first for 3.5yrs and I've had the second for 4yrs now."
14913,I got wicked intense panicy anxiety for the first 6 months that was terrible.
14914,"The first time I didn't connect it to nexplanon, but I did the second time and I don't plan on replacing it."
14915,I'm pretty sure most of the intense anxiety I've had over the past 10 years was in some way related to hormonal contraception.
14916,"I'm going to have it removed soon because I'm dealing with a lot of other health issues and need to remove a variable related to my period (or breakthrough bleeding, as it were, given nexplanon suppressing ovulation)."
14917,So all hormonal options are out for me.
14918,"I'm planning on tracking using fertility awareness methods, so I know when I'm ovulating and at highest risk for pregnancy."
14919,"And using single or double barrier methods on top of that during the preovulatory fertile periods (basically condoms plus diaphragm or cervical cap) or one barrier method plus withdrawal/pull out, if at a lower fertility risk day."
14920,"And I'm also going to ask for an advance prescription for emergency contraception for Ella (ulipristal acetate) because in addition to delaying ovulation (like Plan B levonogestrel), it also thins the lining of the uterus, preventing pregnancy by making implantation more difficult."
14921,"So if I've already ovulated and the condom breaks and the diaphragm falls out, I have a third back up plan, albeit not a strong one (Plan B doesn't do anything if you've already ovulated)."
14922,"By using the fertility awareness methods, I'll know when I've ovulated, which in addition to informing me which type of emergency contraception r should use, it also means I'll also know when I'm in the luteal phase (after the egg has been released and is no longer viable), and can have unprotected sex safely (though I'll still probably use one method anyway, just to be sure)."
14923,"it's going to be extra effort from the daily tracking (about 510mins a day) but the effectiveness is going to be comparable to nexplanon as long as my partner and I follow the rules, use double barrier methods during the fertile window, and use a conservative calculation for the fertile window."
14924,I take norethindrone and I use this fancy overpriced smart birth control case called Emme.
14925,It has an app that reminds you to take it and it automatically senses when you took it and logs it for you.
14926,Its definitely pricey (100) but I never missed a single pill!
14927,The condoms thing is still something I'm not sure about.
14928,"They're kinda inconvenient, expensive, and of course my husband is one of those guys who doesn't like them."
14929,"If course if I straight up demanded it of him he would do it and wouldn't really complain much, but I don't want either of us to suffer of find sex unenjoyable.As for a different minipill idk."
14930,I live in a small town.
14931,When I talked to my doctor about the minipill she actually had no idea about anything about it lmao.
14932,She said she had never prescribed it to anyone before and put me on norethindrone or whatever it's called and didn't give me any options so I'd need to try and either ask or go to a different doctor.
14933,So idk how many options are really available to me rn.
14934,"She really talked up nexplanon, saying she's given that to many women who love it but yea I'm not having the best time with it."
14935,I'll have to try and talk to my doctor about it.
14936,"My combo pill was Kurvelo, not sure the composition on it."
14937,"My doctor however, doesn't know much about mini pills."
14938,She said she's never prescribed them before.
14939,"I also live in a very small town with only one other doctor and I actually tried to set up that place as my primary care place, but they kept ducking my calls and never getting back to me.She had put me on norethindrone I think it was for the mini pill and didn't give me any other options."
14940,Haha I've considered getting that case many times just because it's so cute  Definitely smart for norethindrone!
14941,Totally understandable about condoms.
14942,"I don't find them enjoyable either tbh!Your provider not knowing about even the norethindrone minipill is wild haha, it's been around forever."
14943,I used to live in a tiny town though and I know how it is.
14944,There is a lot to love about Nexplanon but the breakthrough bleeding etc.
14945,can be super hard to live with until it stops (if it does).Look into Slynd some and see if it appeals to you.

14947,"It's easy to get it sent to your pharmacy via telehealth (Planned Parenthood app, My Pill and More, pick your provider of choice) if you don't feel like educating your local doctors lol."

14949,Im switching to the Kyleena IUD once my insurance approves it hopefully soon!
14950,"Just curious, has anyone else experienced stronger sugar cravings while on a mainly estrogen pill?"
14951,Not just before or during your period but throughout your whole cycle?
14952,Ive noticed I get strong sugar cravings all the time on my current pill.

14958,My patch has a wrinkle in the middle that sort of lifts up at the sides.
14959,"It's pretty small, but when I was showering a lot of water got in there."
14960,The patch still adheres to the skin and isn't falling off in any way.

14969,It should still work if its still stuck on you
14970,Im at about 4 and a half years with my Liletta IUD so its set to expire in a few months.
14971,"Just about 8 months ago or so I REALLY started to feel what I thought were regular PMS/period symptoms with just a little bit of spotting, but the more I live with it the more I find that the cramping lasts longer (were talking 2 every month) and I just recently noticed that sex has even become painful in certain positions."
14972,Ive been with the same partner for about a year and I never had this problem of discomfort when we first started seeing each other.
14973,Its gotten to the point that I would rather just avoid sex which isnt fair to either one of us.
14974,I already planned on taking out my IUD and going BC free when it expires but Im wondering if maybe I should just do it sooner?
14975,Has anyone else ever experienced this?
14976,It could be something else completely (I thought PID for a minute) but Ive tried to research my symptoms and none of the results really match how Ive been feeling.
14977,Maybe it really is just my period coming back with a vengeance as the IUD slowly starts to die out.
14978,Any insight is helpful lol

14983,"Hey everyone, Ive been on progesterone only birth control for a few months now."
14984,"The type that I take continuously, no sugar pills.I feel like Im ovulating."
14985,"My discharge is thick and like egg whites, Im getting cramping like I usually do when ovulating."
14986,So Im wondering how does this birthcontrol work if its not preventing ovulation?Im not taking it for pregnancy prevention so its not an issue but definitely a confusion.
14987,The mini pill prevents pregnancy by thickening cervical mucous and thinning the uterine lining.
14988,It depends on which mini pill it is how consistently it stops ovulation.
14989,Since you have no placebo pills I am guessing either norethindrone or desogestrel?
14990,Desogestrel is more likely to stop ovulation than norethindrone.
14991,"But with either one if you are ovulating it is still effective for pregnancy prevention, they work in multiple ways including thickening cervical mucus and thinning uterine lining."
14992,Progesterone only birth control can prevent ovulation but it doesnt consistently.
14993,It prevents pregnancy by thickening cervical mucus so sperm cant get through and thinning the lining of the uterus so an egg cant attach.
14994,"Progesterone only methods include mini pills, depo shot, Nexplanon and hormonal iuds."
14995,Ive used mini pills 4 years no condoms and no pull out never got pregnant.
14996,Used depo shot 6 months no condoms and no pull out never got pregnant.
14997,Ive used mirena iud for on going year 6 now no pull out and no condoms and never gotten pregnant.
14998,I also ovulate every month based on my discharge.
14999,If you take it correctly you should be fine.
15000,Dont leave it in heat.
15001,If you vomit or have diarrhea within 3 hours it counts as a missed pill and should use condoms for 2 days if its the norethindrone mini pill.

15043,I put it in on Aug 24th and towards the beginning of the second week I started experiencing brown discharge/blood spotting.. Ive never had this besides during the ends of my period.

15063,If there are still massive issues by month 3 you could consider a different pill.
15064,4 years in and I still bleed 3 weeks at a time!
15065,I had an 18 month break and switched to depo which stopped the periods but Im back on desogestrel and bleeding is the same as it was the first time round!
15066,I hate it!
15067,Okay thanks.
15068,Do you think it will eventually even out though?

15077,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
15078,I switched this year from being on the pill for almost 15 years to the Mirena.
15079,The insertion was unpleasant but not unbearable.
15080,The speculum is always a bit umcomfy for me but no painful.
15081,"The ""sound"" used to measure the uterus also feels similar, I could tell something was there, but it was an uncomfortable, weird sensation versus pain."
15082,The insertion of the device felt like a quick sharp cramp that turned into dull cramps for the rest of the afternoon.
15083,"It hurt, but only for about 10 seconds then it was done."
15084,I was absolutely terrified but it was totally bearable and worth it for me.
15085,"But everyone is going to have a difference experience story, and people who have positive but unremarkable experiences are less likely to share these."
15086,"My libido went through the roof about 2 weeks after I had it put in, so it's been a really good change for me, no bleeding in the 6 months I've had it (apart from a short bleed a week after insertion) and no cramps or side effects apart from minor skin breakouts.Plus, the Kyleena is slightly smaller than the Mirena, so I would think that it would make the insertion slightly less painful/uncomfortable."
15087,I havent used a birth control/contraceptive before and Im thinking about using Nexaplanon.
15088,Ive heard different stories.
15089,"apparently, you can stay on your period for months, but on the other hand you can stop bleeding for months as well?"
15090,Ive heard many negative things but also many positive things so I dont know what to do.
15091,Does anyone know the statistics on people whove used this contraceptive and bled for months vs people whove had no changes to their cycle vs people who have gone off their period for months?
15092,Also when is the best time to get the contraceptive if any?
15093,Thank you
15094,"Unfortunately, theres no way to predict what your side effects could be, if any."
15095,You can have it inserted and removed at any time.
15096,If you get it during the first few days of your period youll be protected immediately.
15097,I agree there is no way to know without just trying it.
15098,I think it is a great method to try first because if it does work out for you it is so easy and effective.
15099,"If it doesn't, you can get it removed and try something else."
15100,"I had prolonged but light bleeding on my Nexplanon and I still almost got it again, but decided to try Slynd instead."
15101,"I think about 1 in 5 stop bleeding entirely with the odds going up the longer you keep it, not sure about the stats for other bleeding profiles though."
15102,"if you have history of rashes or eczema, beware!"
15103,risk of an abscess forming at the nexplanon insertion site is increased if you have a hx of eczema/atopic dermatitis.
15104,i wish i had known this before i needed my nexplanon removed due to a HUGE abscess growth  im on the mini pill now.
15105,I currently have nexaplanon!
15106,Or at least the generic ver of it D I love it even though Im currently having the bleeding for weeks issue.
15107,I originally didnt have my period for the first month but ended up w some spotting and its been very light bleeding/spotting since.
15108,"I personally dont mind it, its way better than preimplant me as I had really heavy and painful periods before."
15109,"Im currently only 2 n half months since I got it inserted but I can update once I meet 3 months, 6 months and etc as I heard it improves once youre close to a year."

15136,"I got pregnant in the second year of Paragard, I know how scary it is.In my experience, they start by measuring hCG every two days or so to see if hCG is increasing at a normal rate."
15137,"If it's decreasing that's a miscarriage, if it's increasing as expected it's viable, and if it's increasing but only slowly that could be an indicator it's ectopic (although it could just be off to a slow start)."
15138,"This early it's likely not going to show up on an ultrasound, tracking hCG is your best bet."
15139,"Mine still wasn't visible on ultrasound after 5 weeks and hCG over 300, but I'm guessing your ultrasound was just to check IUD position?Whether you plan to keep or abort (r/abortion is a great support resource) they will have to remove the IUD."
15140,"Removing the IUD may trigger a miscarriage, but the risk of random miscarriage is actually higher if left of place."
15141,"Also, Mirena can have an impact on developing fetuses if they turn out to be female, so definitely get it out."
15142,"You cannot have an abortion with the IUD in place, whether medical or surgical."
15143,"If it is ectopic there is a chemical they will give you to dissolve the pregnancy, but you may need surgery."
15144,Assume it's a viable pregnancy unless indicated otherwise.
15145,"I know, the waiting is absolutely impossible."
15146,Every twinge in my abdomin had me convinced it was ectopic and I needed to go straight to the ER.
15147,"Ultimately mine was viable, IUD removal did not trigger a miscarriage, and I had a medical abortion at home."
15148,"It's not your fault, you did everything right and don't deserve to go through this, but it's going to be okay eventually."

15156,Right now it seems Im in the waiting stage of tracking my hCG to see what they do next (if its ectopic or not or a chemical pregnancy) I was wondering if after termination you went back on the IUD or you were discouraged and used other forms of BC?
15157,Part of me is like yeah the IUD is the safest option but at the same time my reality tells me otherwise LOL.

15160,"Right after the MA we were using condoms for a while, but I eventually decided to try a POP."
15161,I have maximum control to know if I take my pill perfectly or not.
15162,"I've already tried two different IUDs (Mirena and Paragard) and both experiences were catastrophic failures, so I will never use IUDs again."
15163,"Absolutely never, ever again."
15164,"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me."
15165,We used the pullout method perfectly for over five years with more success than I've had with IUDs.
15166,"I can't use estrogencontaining methods and already had a bad experience on the injection, so my only options left were POPs or the arm implant."
15167,"My sister had a terrible time on the implant, I wanted the most control and I didn't want a scar, and so basically POPs were my only choice in my mind even if they aren't as good as the implant."
15168,(Also the Nexplanon full prescribing info cautions against using it if you are overweight so I didn't want to risk it even though many overweight people use it successfully.)
15169,I have experienced poor mental health on every method I've tried (and only ever while on birth control) so Im glad I can stop the pills if I need to.
15170,"I'm not loving norethindrone so far, but the depression doesn't have me doing anything drastic yet so I'm going to push though to three months if I can."

15217,"I have previously been on Ovranette and didnt have as severe symptoms, mainly just dealt with being emotional but it wasnt as debilitating as this, but this was a while ago and I know some people have different experiences when going back onto the same pill.I would just really love to hear if anyone had a similar experience with microgynon and what pill they went on instead with more manageable/less side effects, Ive been told ovranette is basically the same ingredients as microgynon so Im not sure whether its worth trying it again, so if anyone has had a bad experience with microgynon, what pill worked for you?"

15222,I (24) have been on the pill for about 9 years.
15223,"After discussing switching to a different method on birth control, we (me and my doctor) decide to first give being off an method a try."
15224,I started taking the pill soley because of the pain my periods would cause were so bad I'd miss whole weeks of school.
15225,"However, even now I feel that my periods may be just as bad and it isn't worth taking a medication that isn't necessarily helping."
15226,"That being said, are there any common effects that come with getting off the pill, especially after being on for so long?"

15253,i would like to know what your experience was like if youve ever had it yourself.
15254,"I am personally worried about acne, weight gain, and mood swings."
15255,i know these are likely with any hormonal birth control and i know birth control affects everyone different.
15256,id just like to hear about some other peoples experiences.
15257,First and only birth control I've ever been on.
15258,Have been super lucky with my experience.
15259,"Had some headaches the first month and had a bit of weight gain, but no other symptoms appeared."
15260,My life is still like it always has just now without fear of pregnancy.
15261,Getting my second implant next week.
15262,Ive had some irregular bleeding which is pretty annoying and I had some acne the first couple months but that leveled out.
15263,No weight gain or mood swings.
15264,I personally like mine minus the bleeding.
15265,Its just spotting though which Im grateful for.
15266,I love mine.
15267,Its been 2.5 years and Im getting another soon.
15268,Typically bleed every 23 months although that is increasing to more like 1.51 month now that the dosage is decreasing.
15269,I havent had any other side effects.
15270,My mood and libido are much better compared to the pill.
15271,Six months in and im really good.

15278,"Not to scare you, but my Nexplanon experience was a nightmare."
15279,The first six months were great no period and no other symptoms.
15280,"Then all of a sudden I got a period, and it didnt stop for two months straight."
15281,Not only did I develop an iron deficiency but also entered a depressive episode that wouldnt lift.
15282,"I was extremely fatigued all the time, depressed and anxious."
15283,"Removing it was the best thing ever, lol."
15284,Everyone is different and I actually decided with Nexplanon after my friend told me about her positive experience and not having a period for years.
15285,I was done being depressed and developing acne which I am not prone to on the pill.
15286,"BUT it was an absolute nightmare for me, I bled (spotting and periods mixed in) for a year and half straight maybe 23 days without any bleeding but it would return."
15287,My libido was nonexistent so I joked about it being so effective because I never wanted sex.
15288,I was depressed and anxious the first 3 months of having it and not sure if it continued to affect me because I have depression and GAD lol.
15289,I got it taken out last week after having it for 4.5 years because I wasn't sure which birth control I wanted to go with next since hormonal birth control doesn't agree with me.
15290,I'm trying out the Mirena IUD right now.
15291,My experience was medium.
15292,"There were a lot of things I really liked about it, the insertion/removal was a breeze and relatively painless, I liked how easy it was to check that it was still in place, it didn't give me the nausea/vomiting much less the stroke I had on estrogen methods, no pill or ring to forget, that crazy high effective rate just really relieved my pregnancy anxiety and that it can't really expel the way IUDs do on occasion."
15293,But I was one of the ones that had prolonged bleeding.
15294,"It was light and manageable, but not exactly fun!"
15295,"It did however work miracles with my endometriosis pain, it was leaps and bounds better than anything else I tried for endo."
15296,"I kept it for 5 years and strongly considered getting a second one and would still recommend it because I think it is absolutely worth seeing if it works for someone because if it does, man is it an amazing method."
15297,Ultimately I switched to Slynd because my neurologist was a little concerned Nexplanon was aggravating my migraines...but we're not sure because I got it not long after my stroke so the increase may be related to the stroke more than the implant.
15298,i just got mine a few days ago (i still have the 3day bandage on) so this is mainly about my experience with the insertion!
15299,"my dr poked around my arm a bit, had me flex my arm, and drew a couple dots and lines on my arm to get the placement."
15300,"i have a hard times with needles, maybe its the location or my person pain tolerance but the numbing medication didnt hurt at all (no more than a reg shot)."
15301,she poked around my arm a bit more and the medication worked quickly and effectively!
15302,i didnt even realize she was starting to place it until i was told by my mom who i made come with me lol.
15303,i could feel the implant going in but just the pressure of something going into my arm with zero pain.
15304,"theyll put some medical tape, gauze, and a pressure bandage on the site afterwards."
15305,the pressure bandage and gauze can come off after 24 hours but the tape has to stay on for 3 days and cant get wet so maybe shower before the appointment!
15306,"the numbing medicine came off soon after i left the office but i personally didnt experience major pain in the area, jus soreness."
15307,i got mine put it at planned parenthood so some things may be a little different but i cant imagine that it wildly changes.the next day i woke up with a headache and nausea but it was manageable.
15308,the nausea went away with eating/snacking consistently and the headache lingered but wasnt severe.
15309,i havent had mine in long so i cant tell you much about side effects but this might help you feel better about the insertion process because it was my biggest worry!
15310,"It was probably the worst thing I've ever done to my body, and I have deep regrets about using it at all.First 3 days, extreme moodiness and ideation."
15311,Generally really annoyed with everything and everyone (did a good job of masking it) for another few months before it turned into a little buzz of low level irritation constantly.My skin started sagging and I got my first white hairsI gained 35 pounds of weight in 9 months.
15312,Im in college and live in a Southern state where abortion is illegal.
15313,I have SUCH bad pregnancy anxiety and just recently got a copper IUD but i ser do many girls on tiktok get pregnant with it  isnt it supposed to be one of the most effective?
15314,i was on the pill for 6 months and never got pregnant but i felt good because i could SEE my pills and took them myself.
15315,I cant see or feel my IUD inside me so it scares me that it wont work
15316,Stop scaring yourself by watching TikTok videos.
15317,That'll only fuel your anxiety more.
15318,"If you don't trust the copper IUD, pair it with condoms, have your partner pull out, take monthly pregnancy tests, or even switch to a different method."

15324,Most people who get pregnant on its because Id it displacing.
15325,You could also take a test once a month.
15326,Heavy bleeding is also incompatible with pregnancy so if you have a heavy cycle youll know you arent pregnant.
15327,Personally Im on Nexplanon and still use condoms 95 of the time.
15328,At the very least my partner pulls out.
15329,You can feel your strings and make sure its in the right place.

15346,using condoms along with birth controlhow protected am i really?
15347,lets say i take my birth control perfect besides one missed pill every 6 months or so (i just missed on and woke up to take it 13 hours later on the combo pill) and every time we use the condom he doesnt pull out but makes sure to hold the base when pulling out after finishing along with check for leaks after.
15348,how protected am i?
15349,we used to use this method along with pulling out but recently decided to do away with pulling out since i did my research and looking at the statistics it didnt change much of my protective rate but i want to come on here and get an opinion.
15350,i shouldnt be worried about pregnancy at all correct?
15351,should we go back to adding pull out into our routine?
15352,who here trusts just their birth control would it still be wise and safe to let him use no condom but pull out?

15463,It actually increases your risk for blood clots to do that as well as making it hard for your body to adjust since it usually takes 3 months of consecutive use for your body to adjust.
15464,Youve likely just confused your body by starting and stopping.
15465,Wow!
15466,Did not know about the blood clots thing.
15467,Kind of wish my provider gave me more info.
15468,She basically just said if my legs start hurting to come see her because it could be blood clots and said I may gain weight.
15469,Im sure she didnt expect me to be stupid and take them on and off but more info wouldve been appreciated.
15470,Thank god for other Bc users experience otherwise I wouldve been convinced I was pregnant.

15486,Ive been quite stressed out lately from work and im on new anti anxiety medication so maybe thats a factor?
15487,Please help!
15488,have u taken the pill at the same hour every day?
15489,sometimes taking it at different times can cause that.

15496,ive been on the combo pill for 5 years and i get random break through bleeding every now and then.
15497,2 years ago i upped the dose to stop it but the hormones were making me feel sick so i went back down to the original dose and just accepted the break through bleeding lol.
15498,it could be stress related bc im stressed all the time and also on some psych meds
15499,I have had the nexplanon arm implant for over a year and after about four months I stopped bleeding or having cramps.
15500,However two days ago I just started to bleed a little and have very light cramps.
15501,Is this normal for cramping / bleeding to occasionally return or should I make a visit to the doctor ?
15502,Previously Ive had very light spotting but this feels more like an actual period just very very light.

15507,This is normal
15508,Its normal.
15509,Thanks I just wanted to be sure I figured it was still sort of new to BC and I dont know anyone else who uses Nexplanon
15510,Bleeding patterns on Nexplanon are insanely unpredictable so hopefully it doesnt last long for you!
15511,I hope so too !!
15512,Im just more worried about the cramps  its the whole reason I got on BC because mine were atrocious
15513,I stopped the pill almost a month ago and shortly after stopping it (maybe a week or 2) I noticed my vision getting worse and my eyes just generally being tired.
15514,"I have other symptoms as well, like fatigue, but I am not pregnant."
15515,"I know that people experience vision changes going ON birth control, but has anyone had the same experience coming off of it?Maybe its all coincidence and has nothing to do with my hormones?"
15516,I dont know.
15517,"I do know that Ive had three babies and after each pregnancy my vision has worsened..my eyes are also very effected during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but I dont know if going off birth control would cause them to be effected as well."
15518,Has anyone experienced this in relation to going off the pill?

15524,One of my friends who came off had to see a neuro ophthalmologist as her vision was drastically affected.
15525,"As the title saysI've read a few articles about tribulus terrestris and while it is more of something men take, it seems like it's beneficial for women and their hormonal health as well."
15526,I just don't know if it'll affect my IUD effectiveness?Did anyone try this combo?I have a Mirena IUD for reference.
15527,From looking it up it doesnt look like there are any easily available studies on wether it interferes with birth control.
15528,You should consult your doctor before trying any kind of supplement while on birth control.

15532,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
15533,I went to obgyn because I wanted IUD as emergency contraception and I was told they couldnt do it if I was not on my period.
15534,That when you are not on your period it doesnt go in.
15535,They could only take it out if not on period but not put it in.
15536,Is this info correct?
15537,"I dont think this is correct, it may be easier on period but doubt that its impossible when not bleeding."
15538,Have you had a similar experience?
15539,"When I had Paragard inserted, I wasn't on my period."
15540,"I didn't have any insertion issues.If you still want one, go find a gyno who will insert one regardless of if you're on your period or not."
15541,I live in France and my gynecologist insisted to put it in on my period.
15542,It's mainly because the cervix is softer and more open so it's easier and less painful.
15543,It also ensures you're not pregnant and reduces the risk of infection.However to have it removed they can do whether you're on or off your period.
15544,"It depends on the obgyn, I know mine also places IUDs when someones on their period but some places dont require it."
15545,If theres a planned parenthood nearby they might be willing to.
15546,I had to get Paragard put in for emergency contraception too.
15547,I wasnt on my period either.
15548,"The pain was quite bad, but I knew that since I had already had a horrible iud insertion previously."
15549,"Honestly, take any pain medicine you feel you need."
15550,I know they say that ibuprofen is enough but it wasnt for me.
15551,Its been a few years now and Im still happy with it.
15552,I got it when I wasnt on my period and it went very well  wasnt painful at all besides the sensation of mild period cramps.
15553,Years later and my paragard iud is still perfectly in place.
15554,"Theyre wrong, I guess some doctors have a very rigid and useless set of requirements for some things"
15555,so I had Mirena inserted NOT on my period  Kyleena inserted ON my period.
15556,I personally had opposite experiences.
15557,Kyleena hurt more during my period  Mirena hurt much much less not during my period ( thats apparently the bigger IUD).
15558,Same dr did both IUDs but insisted that being on my period was easier.
15559,Maybe for him but not me lol
15560,"If anything, it may be more painful off your period (cause the cervix will be naturally dilated ON your period), but for most bodies, the insertion can still be done."
15561,Dr here.
15562,"It is an old practice that stems from the adage everybody lies, and it prevents a dr from putting one in on someone who is pregnant."
15563,It stems from patriarchal views and oppression and also a paternalistic practice of medicine in which pts dont know enough and shouldnt be trusted.
15564,"Nowadays all literature permits us to put any device in with several conditions that excludes pregnancy, such as an active period, celibacy, having a previous IUD or implant (like a renewal), and pt history  a negative pregnancy test."
15565,"While it may be true it is a hospital or national policy, it is not based on medical fact and is harmful for people who desire contraception as it prevents them access from appropriate medical care."
15566,Hopefully you can find a good dr to help you with that.
15567,Also remember you are entitled to local anesthetics and empathetic care.
15568,Same thing happened to me!
15569,It was the clinic wanting to make sure I wasnt pregnant so they wanted me to get my period first which is silly because the whole point of me going was because I needed it as emergency contraceptive.
15570,"No, you dont have to be on your period."
15571,It just makes it easier.
15572,Obviously if it's for emergency contraception you will not be on your period  It's often done during your period because it's less painful but it's not mandatory at all.
15573,Find another Dr
15574,I wonder if it's because the doctor wants to make absolutely sure you're not pregnant.
15575,Makes sense to me to get it inserted while on your cycle.
15576,"I would be like, I think you need to renew your license ."
15577,Did they even try??
15578,"Sometimes they can't get an IUD past the cervix, it happened to me with my 1st and all they did was prescribe me a cervix softener and rescheduled"
15579,I think its because theyre probably had issues with insertion in the past when patients are not on their period.
15580,I have had two IUDs in my lifetime.
15581,I was not on my period during either insertion.
15582,Granted the second insertion (12 years later) was really hard but doable.
15583,The nurse practitioner did say it is easier to insert during menstruation

15587,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
15588,It must just be the place you went to.
15589,Mine had asked me how recently my period had been.
15590,"Depending on your cycle, inserting the IUD will hurt a LOT more."
15591,"They already have to open your cervix to insert it, so not being on your period or near your period can make it harder  more painful."
15592,I wasnt on my period when I had gotten mine it was a horrible experience though haha Good luck x
15593,"Huh, weird."
15594,When I had the mirena my doctor's office insisted it needed to be inserted when I wasn't on my period because it was less messy and the doctor could see what she was doing better.
15595,"Not sure if regulations are different for hormonal, or if they're just different in my location."
15596,I live in Texas and had my Paraguard inserted the same day my Mirena was taken out.
15597,I wasnt on my period at the time and I never heard of needing to be on your period for insertion.
15598,they tried to pull this on me too when i was only 18  had no idea how to advocate for myself.
15599,lmao i gave that nurse such a hard time until they called in the manager on duty and she told the nurse off too.
15600,then i got my birth control.
15601,worst birth control ever but i needed it for an emergency contraceptive.
15602,im on nexplanon now and while its not perfect i like it SO MUCH MORE than paragard
15603,"When I had my  IUD put in, my obgyn specifically asked and waited for me to be on my period."
15604,"He said the cervix is lower, more maleable and more open during that time (resulting in easier and less painful insertion), which is true.Im not saying it wasnt possible to do while not on your period, but Im assuming the doctor either wasnt confident enough to do it without proper insertion conditions or didnt want to cause you more pain than needed."
15605,Ridiculous!
15606,"They can put it in at any time of the month!Caveat to say, where I am, due to strict abortion laws, they won't do it if there is a risk you might be pregnant (even though its emergency contraception  so I'm not sure how that works and am glad it hasn't been something I've had to look into)."
15607,"The place I got mine (generic copper not paraguard specifically) insisted I not only take the pill for a month before they would insert it, but that I was also abstinent for 2 weeks before it!!"
15608,Lol she tried to convince me that they would be able to tell if I wasn't!!
15609,"All of which is totally ridiculous, the pill should have been enough."
15610,"But anyway I digress, the point was, once they were sure I wasn't pregnant, the when of it didn't matter."
15611,"Also, in case anyone queries it, I was specifically told they couldn't put it in when on my period because the doctor who does it only works in their clinic 2 days a week and is very busy so there wouldn't be a hope of lining it up with my period."
15612,Apparently all drs from where are I live strictly require you to be on period.
15613,This is in Mexico so that may play a role.
15614,"I just find so strange that they dont know this information, he said its not possible if Im not bleeding which is wrong."
15615,They didnt want to put it.
15616,My guess is he is not skilled enough or updated.
15617,Im very surprised since in order for him to say that only you can do it on your period it just means he doesnt know it works as emergency contraception.
15618,This should be fundamental for him to know but oh well.
15619,Agreed!
15620,My insertion hurt WAY more on/right at the end of my period than when I wasnt on my period!
15621,I think that's odd because what happens when you go from your first IUD to the next and you don't have periods anymore?
15622,They going to make you wait until it comes back?
15623,"I am on my 2nd mirena and I think the first time I may have been on mine, but afterward it went away so 2nd insertion was without it."
15624,"Idk seems odd, here in the states they said it's ideal, but not a deal breaker if you're not on it."
15625,Best advice is to get a second opinion.
15626,"Thats not why many docs will only place on your period, but they can prescribe misoprostol as a cervical ripening agent and then place it."
15627,"Getting off the pill (progestin  estrogren) I've been on and off it since I was 16, but mostly taking it consistently."
15628,"(I'm 31 now) Not trying to get pregnant, just want to see how my body does without hormonal birth control."
15629,"My gf is trans and we don't have p in v sex all the time anyway, but planning to use condoms when we do (and also track ovulation cycle to know when riskiest time to have sex is."
15630,)Just curious what symptoms people have experienced after getting off the pill.
15631,Weight gain or loss?
15632,Less energy or more?
15633,Depression and anxiety?
15634,I already struggle with these so hoping I don't experience anything too bad!

15682,"The weirdest thing is that the strings can be felt ""upon entry"" IYKYK ) but its not anything to worry about.With the copper IUD the biggest downside is that if it moves out of place you don't have hormones as a second layer of protection."

15684,Thanks for the info!

15686,Or did you go straight to the coil?
15687,"Never tried the pill before, I can't be trusted to remember to take it properly and didn't want to risk it."
15688,I've had a friend go from the pill to Nexplanon and then to IUD and the IUD is by far her favorite from what she has shared.
15689,"It's definitely the most intimidating type of semipermanent BC outside of sterilization because of how its implanted but the thing to remember is that the installation takes less than 15 minutes and most providers will give you laughing gas for the pain, I had to pay like 75 but it was totally worth it."
15690,"Very fair, luckily taking it on time was never an issue for me  I would 100 stay on the pill if it wasn't for the side effects ') But at least with the IUD it'll be one less thing to worry about remembering hah."
15691,Good to know that it worked out well for your friend who switched though!It's definitely intimidating!

15697,"For context, I have had nexplanon before, but it was years ago and I had no period or odd discharge ever."
15698,I got my new nexplanon in late June (about 3 months ago).
15699,My period was 2 weeks late when I first got it (figured it was the birth control).
15700,Since that period I HAVE NOT STOPPED BLEEDING.
15701,"It's either red and heavy like a period, or (for the 20 something days in between) its a light or dark brown discharge depending on how heavy."
15702,It makes me want to pull my hair out.
15703,It never ends.
15704,Has anyone had this experience?
15705,"If so, do you know when it might stop?"
15706,Bleeding is a common side effect of Nexplanon!
15707,It usually goes away after the first 612 months.
15708,"Theres a couple ways to stop/ regulate bleeding (ibuprofen trial, taking birth control pills on top of Nexplanon, etc.)"

15727,When I got Paragard I had moderate cramping for about 23 weeks and had light cramping between periods about 2 months after placement.
15728,"After month 2 was over, my body felt like it was adjusting well."
15729,Everyones experience is going to be different but I have to say the cramping wasnt too bad.
15730,I was ok with coping with cramping for a few weeks but know that Im protected.
15731,I have the mirena but I am wanting to regulate my body  have been thinking about the Paraguard.
15732,"I have had it for 45 years now and have loved it so far, but I am scared for the fact of not having a period at all."
15733,"My mom went into MENOP at 32, so makes me even more nervous."

15741,"If Mirena is working, I would stick with it."
15742,Skipping your period with hormonal birth control is fine.
15743,It has nothing to do with when your body will enter menopause.
15744,"If you are worried that this may be a genetic thing that could also happen to you, Id go to a doctor."
15745,Paraguard tends to cause more side effects like painful cramps and heavier periods.
15746,"You can always try it, but I would wait until you are finished with Mirena."
15747,I like my copper IUD.
15748,"While I know that for a lot of people suppressing their period is a benefit to them, it wasn't for me personally."
15749,I was just constantly worried I was pregnant.
15750,I personally like getting a regular period because it kind of makes me think that things are cycling and going as they should.
15751,"But I have bearable periods, even with the copper IUD, and hormones did not play well with my own biology."
15752,Thank you!!

15765,"I (35,F) am contemplating having my Mirena taken out soon as I want to focus more on regulating my hormones naturally and not with birth control anymore, and am sick of the side effects I've had."
15766,"This is my 2nd Mirena, so I estimate it's been about 7 years on this, and I was on pills before that...so it's been awhile."
15767,"I did not get regular periods during the entirety of my Mirena, just spotting here and there."

15787,"Agreed I recently changed to nighttime, makes a big difference."
15788,The minipill peaks on your system like 16 hours after you take it so you can sleep through that.
15789,Previously I took mine at 1230pm and I dealt with side effects.OP which minipill are you taking?
15790,Ill try and wait it out.
15791,Im taking my pill at 530600 pm today instead of my usual 12 pm.
15792,So we will see if there is any difference.Today Im testing it and eating like a hospital patient lol.
15793,Just bland food like toast and stuff.
15794,Then we will see if its just unavoidable
15795,Cerazette/desogestrel.
15796,I get no side effects during the day.
15797,However when I wake up the next morning I feel nauseous.
15798,I think its due to my diet and how the pill reacts to my diet lol.
15799,I feel like actual shit when I eat junk food now.
15800,"Even when I eat healthy, it still isnt great but its no where near as bad."
15801,"Its odd why I get these symptoms almost 24 hours after though, and Im wondering what diet could help me out here or if I just need to power through until my body gets used to it."
15802,Cant find anything on Google
15803,Ahh.
15804,"Im sorry youre going through that, I had a similar experience on a different pill."
15805,Just constant nausea and food aversions no matter what time I took the pill.
15806,Hopefully it gets better over time!
15807,Did you switch pill or did it eventually get better for you?
15808,"Thanks, hopefully it will"
15809,"It didnt get better on that pill after 5 months and I switched, but that was a combo pill."
15810,The side effects were worse all around in that case.
15811,"hello, I take my pill at 10pm and I puked at 11pm."
15812,I mainly vomited stomach acid and didnt see the pill.
15813,I took another active pill at 6 am because I couldnt and was worried I wouldnt be able to keep it down with how sick I was feeling.
15814,Do I need to take another one today?
15815,Am I still protected?
15816,Thank you so much!

15838,If this isnt the right community for this post plz lmk.
15839,"So I have been off and on the birth control pill for years, and I most recently got back on it end of august."
15840,I had only taken about 45 pills but then I had unprotected sex with my bf.
15841,"I had started mid cycle and I am aware that it takes a full 7 days to become effective, so I very nervously took the Ella emergency contraceptive the day after sex."
15842,This was specifically Fri Aug 25 when I took Ella.
15843,"I stopped taking my pills because of Ella, and I got back on it on Thurs Aug 31."
15844,"Ever since then, I have been consistently taking my pill at the same time every night, So its been about 1213 days back on the pill."
15845,Now heres where I need advice.
15846,I had unprotected sex last night with my bf and he came inside me.
15847,Usually I wouldnt be worrying but Ive been reading that after taking Ella you arent protected for a full month even on birth control pills.
15848,"Im supposed to start my placebo week of pills next week, so I suppose Ill see if I get the withdrawal bleed and confirm Im not pregnant, but does anyone have any thoughts or advice for me??"
15849,Im just really nervous rn bc I definitely do NOT want to get pregnant rn.
15850,You don't have to wait a full month.
15851,"After taking ella you need to take a break from your regular birth control for 56 days, like you did, and then use a backup method until you've taken 7 active pills (9 if you're on Qlaira/Natazia) So from the day you take ella you need to wait around two weeks before you're protected again, and you are already past that point."
15852,"Sources Take a pregnancy test 21 days after sex just to make sure that ella worked, sometimes people miss withdrawal bleedings especially if they also took emergency contraception."
15853,If you make a mistake with the pill in the future it's probably better to take Plan B (levonorgestrel) since it doesn't interact with your regular birth control.

15859,Thank you I appreciate it!
15860,!
15861,Youll also need to skip your placebos and go straight to a new pack since you wont have had a full 21 days of pills before
15862,Ohhh shoot so I was not aware of this.
15863,"Thanks for the info, Ill plan to start my new pack next week then instead of taking the placebos!"
15864,I have yet to take it.
15865,"Me and my bf have only recently being intimate and he's my first bf and I was a virgin before recently, we've been doing condoms which are fine, it's just kinda difficult to find ones that are better for him."
15866,They've worked obviously but I have been thinking about birth control and I've recently bought from nurx amd they prescribed me low dose Junel Fe 1/20.
15867,I've always known birth control has many side effects but actually reading them is freaking me out a whole lot.
15868,I just wanted to know the likelyness of the actually bad side effects.
15869,Obviously I know weight gain and acne and bleeding which aren't terrible but the others like breast lumps and swelling and liver damage sound terrifying.
15870,Has anyone had experiences with any of these severe effects from low dose Junel Fe 1/20 pills?
15871,"?I am 20, I don't smoke, I don't take any other meds, I don't have any conditions that I know of and no known medication allergies."
15872,Please dont worry about those side effects!
15873,"Liver damage isnt a side effect of birth control, its a side effect of ALL medications metabolized in the liver."
15874,"Its only a concern if youre taking very specific medications (hepatitis C treatment, HIV meds, etc.)"
15875,"alongside birth control, or if you have specific medical conditions that effect your liver."
15876,Birth control alone does not cause liver damage.
15877,"Brest lumps are extraordinarily rare, and in fact, birth control can actually _prevent_ breast lumps."
15878,"Its just saying that if you think you may have breast cancer, stop taking hormonal birth control."
15879,Swelling is just another way of describing water weight.
15880,"For some people, birth control can cause increased water retention."
15881,Its a rare side effect and its not permanent or dangerous.
15882,hi!
15883,i am also in your shoes and new to birth control.
15884,"my gyno prescribed me junel 1/20, not fe."
15885,im not sure what the difference between fe and the regular just junel 1/20 is.
15886,"I am currently going to be finishing my first pack this month, ( i have 3 pills left) and the only symptoms ive been feeling or have rn is brown spotting."

15896,ahhhhh okay i see and yup!
15897,"thats when i started it, right when i got my period."
15898,if u take it then ur automatically protected ) try not to stress!
15899,!
15900,so me and my boyfriend are long distance and we usually only meet during holiday breaks and i was wondering if its okay to only take birth control the following weeks before we meet and then stop taking it again after getting home?
15901,This really wouldn't be advised.
15902,"If you only need something sporadically, condoms are your best friend, or look into diagphrams and spermacide."
15903,"Regardless, if you're spending that much time apart, consider using condoms regardless for STI protection because you don't 100 know what he's doing while you're apart."
15904,"Depending on your comfort level on the other end of the spectrum, IUDs are a nice ""set it and forget it"" in that you're always protected, but don't need to actively do anything about it."
15905,"It is gonna take 7 days before it is active, and your body takes 3 months to adjust to the hormones."
15906,"Because you're not planning to take it constantly, your body doesn't have time to adjust to it, making the side effects only worse."
15907,Don't recommend it tbh
15908,Its not recommended to start and stop birth control.
15909,It takes 3 months for your body adjust to the hormones and during that time youre also at a higher risk for blood clots.
15910,Not to mention it takes 7 days to be effective and then 7 days after sex to stay protected.
15911,Your best bet is to just use condoms
15912,Just remember it takes 7 days for the pill to be effective so take it at least 7 days before each visit.
15913,"Sperm can also live for up to 5 days, so  I would just finish the pack youre on whiles hes visiting and then once you reach the placebo week you can stop."
15914,"This is because way youve take all actives and are hence protected from ovulating for 7 days after, if you stopped mid pack you risk ovulating fast while the sperm is still alive, so hence best to finish the pack, to be protectedassuming hes visiting for a few weeks only, if he visits for long enough for you to go on a second pack then finish the second pack and so on until he leaves."
15915,"Basically finish each pack you start whiles hes visiting.If it goes onto a second pack etc you can also skip the placebo of the first pack and go straight onto the active pills of the next pack instead, and then whenever he leaves you can simply stop taking it rather than wait till the placebo of the second pack etc."
15916,"As that way youve taken the actives fir more than 21 days in a row or what3ver amount of actives your pill had, so whenever you t stop you are protected for 7 days after as if youve suddenly decided to take a placebo week."
15917,I wouldnt advise that.
15918,Im pretty sure that wouldnt be advised in general.
15919,It takes a while to adjust and going on and off your body would always be in a state of flux.
15920,This is very hard on your system.
15921,Not to mention you have to be taking it for seven days for it to even be effective.
15922,And you have to keep taking it for at least seven days after you have sex.
15923,If your birth control is making you feel so bad that you only want to take it when you feel you absolutely have to its probably the wrong birth control for you.
15924,"Condoms with pull out, non hormonal IUDs etc are also valid options!"
15925,Just remember if a condom breaks plan b is only effective before you ovulate and for ppl under 150lbs (there is a different one for ppl who weigh more).

15933,"Ideally, just use condoms."
15934,Really dont recommend using birth control for this reason.
15935,"If youre going to go on it, you need to stick with it to keep your protection or else if you stop then start random times it will cause problems and your protection will become jeopardized."
15936,Highly suggest you use a different method like condoms or even consider getting an iud.
15937,"In order for it to become effective, you need to take it everyday at the same time for at least a week and CONTINUE taking it afterwards (sperm lives inside you for up to 5 days) or else you wont be protected."

15966,Yea thats what its designed for
15967,Alright thanks
15968,I havent been on birth control for a few years so Ive forgotten how my body reacted to starting a new pack.
15969,Im looking to have the least amount of side effects as possible so Im wondering if I should just wait to start my period to start my pack or not.
15970,The two week wait isnt very important since Im not having sex at the moment but I plan to eventually hence starting the pill now to get used to the side effects.
15971,But if the effects will feel the same if I just start my pack tomorrow I might as well do that.
15972,I used to take the combo pill about ten years ago because it messed with my moods so much I switched to the mini pill.
15973,It worked great for me because it didnt affect my mood as much.
15974,But its been a while so I just wanted to hear from you guys about your experience with beginning a new pack.
15975,Im on norethindrone and considered this heavily before I started haha.
15976,IMO there is no benefit to waiting to start it.
15977,Every pill in the pack is the same so its not like youre trying to sync up a placebo break with when your period naturally occurred before.
15978,My cycle continued on the same timing as if I wasnt taking the pill (it just got way lighter).

15987,"I don't think when you start has an impact on  side effects, especially since there's no placebo week.I started norethindrone in the middle of my cycle a month ago."
15988,"Initially I had a bunch of severe cramping that went away in about a week, but I've also been dealing with increased acne, headaches, and mood differences the entire month."
15989,"I doubt if I had waited that would have changed anything, since it usually takes months for side effects to ""even out,"" if they ever do."
15990,"i had mirena inserted yesterday and wanted to share my story because they had to manually open my cervix, which i have not read any other stories mentioning this."
15991,i just wanted to make sure others know this can sometimes happen since it caught me kind of off guard.
15992,so i went to my local planned parenthood to get a copper iud placed.
15993,"i was previously on lyleq (pop) after having my nexplanon removed, but after really relying on it for the first time i got nervous that it wasnt effective enough so i made an appointment at PP for copper iud in sort of emergency contraceptive situation."
15994,"turns out, mirena is now approved as emergency contraception so that is great news!"
15995,"and yes, i know it is not technically emergency contraception as i was on the pill, but i wanted something that would cover me from a few days ago."
15996,"anyways, we start the insertion and the NP described the pain as visceral which was spot on."
15997,"everything is moving along as planned, i am 2 major cramps in."
15998,the first cramp is the tenaculum that holds your cervix in place.
15999,"which i will say, in the million stories i read before going, i have yet to see someone mention that the cramp from the tenaculum does not go away."
16000,it just remains as an underlying cramp to the more severe cramps later on.
16001,"then she measures and holy crap, it was such a sharp pain i was in shock."
16002,so everything is moving along until my cervix spasms after she measures and she says that she cant get back through for placement.
16003,she told me were at a crossroads and i have 3 options 1. give up 2. wait it out and hope it relaxes 3. manually open the cervix.
16004,"not really liking any of those plans, we decide to wait a minute or 2 and then try again and if it doesnt work, we will manually open."
16005,"a minute or so later, no dice."
16006,so we agree to manually open.
16007,i would say that pain was on par with the measuring pain.
16008,"she told me its like a cone that progressively gets wider as it goes down, as to open the cervix."
16009,"once she got it open, she had to hold the rod in place for 10 seconds prior to actually placing it, and she let me know when the clock started per my request."
16010,"i felt a sharp pain at insertion that is more than the measuring, and then a weird sensation as she pushed the actual IUD in to place."
16011,"after that, we were done."
16012,she gave me cookies and water and waited with me to make sure i didnt pass out.
16013,"my fianc drove me, which i highly recommend, and then i went home and had awful cramps all day."
16014,"im lucky enough i was able to get 3 days off work but im on day 2 and they are much better and come and go, so 2 days might have sufficed."
16015,"overall, it was painful but not unbearable and it is worth it to me to have at least 6 years of protection."
16016,"if you made it this far, thanks for reading and i hope my story helps prepare you or make you feel less alone in your experience!"
16017,"and if you feel obliged to comment, please be kind )"
16018,I had one placed a year after I had my kid because I wasnt looking to have another for awhile.
16019,"I thought Id be prepared considering what labor was like and, girl, my soul still left my body."
16020,The cramping afterwards was wild.
16021,It still baffles me that most docs say to take Tylenol/Ibuprofen for pain control for this procedure.
16022,Absolute madness.
16023,Felt like my soul was leaving my body.
16024,I had to have this done twice.
16025,The first time I blacked out for a few seconds.
16026,It does hurt immensely and isnt entirely abnormal necessarily based on what Ive been told.
16027,I think every one is different.
16028,"I had all the procedures you described, and it was better than any pap smear I've had."
16029,"No pain, minimal discomfort."
16030,"Not discounting your experience, but I do want others to know that it isn't guaranteed to be horrible."
16031,I'm sorry yours was not easy.
16032,"Yeah, I had to be dilated also."
16033,"I actually needed 2 appointments because the first provider I saw (also at PP) ""hit a wall"" with my cervix and couldn't get in at all."
16034,"So I had to see another provider that had done ""thousands"" of IUD placements because she could dilate me."
16035,It was awful.
16036,Literally the most painful thing that has ever happened to me.
16037,"Same thing, had to leave it in for a while, I assume so the muscle couldn't immediately snap shut before actually placing the IUD."
16038,I don't remember if they actually measured me or just went for it and put it in based on an exterior palpation.
16039,"I have Paraguard which I believe is a hair narrower than Mirena since it doesn't have the hormone reservoir, but is overall the same size unfolded.Since your insertion was similar to mine, be prepared to potentially have a few months of severe, random cramps."
16040,I had a 56 month adjustment period where my body was extremely angry about having something inside of it.
16041,"These were random kneebuckling, grabbing the edge of the table, cramps."
16042,It was shit.
16043,They did go away after those first months.
16044,"But with an approved use period of 12 years, I guess it was worth it."
16045,I had the same experience regarding the tenaculum cramp.
16046,It was definitely a persistent feeling that did not stop until the tool was removed at the end of the procedure.
16047,It was brutal.
16048,Yes I had to have my cervix dilated 6 times with metal rods before they could place the iud.
16049,Its not common but also not unheard of.
16050,Some women have smaller cervical canals.
16051,"I had a numbing pain down my vagina, ass and thighs but thats how my normal periods are."
16052,lol the other day when i was getting my nexplanon replaced she asked about the IUD and i said i was definitely not going to do that because of the amount of times ive seen people say the insertion was really horrible.
16053,"but she said ""it shouldn't hurt if you're sexually active"" which....... having a penis inside your vagina isn't going to make it less painful to open the cervix and jam something into the fallopian tubes  her primary interests was birth control and this was the only thing she said that i completely disagree with?"

16057,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
16058,Was it a metal thing to open the cervix manually?
16059,"i have 0 kids and went into it expecting it to be like the worst period cramps i could imagine, and it isnt even comparable."
16060,i came home and cried for hours.
16061,it was unlike anything i have ever experienced
16062,Same!
16063,I really hope one day they change it
16064,Honestly.
16065,It literally did nothing for me
16066,"thanks for sharing, i havent seen anyone mention it!"
16067,"im sorry you had to have it done twice, it was awful"
16068,"thank you, im glad you had such a good experience!"
16069,"i wasnt trying to scare people away, as i do think the pros (no babies) of it outweigh the cons (pain)."
16070,but i did just want to shed some light as i havent seen many posts mention the manual dilation and it caught me off guard.
16071,so thats all!
16072,"Thank you, this is important too."
16073,Im so sorry that OP had a terrible experience and at the same time I think its important for people to know that there is the whole range.
16074,"My insertion (five different iud/ ius insertions including four from scratch and one replacement), were fine and painless (mild discomfort only).aside from the first one where they gave me a pain relief injection that hurt, and the subsequent times I declined it."
16075,My experience is not universal but its also not unique and I would love for everyone sharing their experiences to emphasise this a little more!
16076,Many bad experiences seem to be worded as if this is what folks should expect.
16077,(Not this OP but others Ive seen).
16078,"oh god, props to you for going back a second time."
16079,"after having a taste of it, idk that i couldve gone back  and great, more to look forward to!"
16080,ive started to experience some of that already.
16081,felt pretty good all day today minus some mild cramping and then about 10pm i started with stabbing pelvic pain that i had to double over until it subsided.
16082,happened for a few hours this is gonna be a long 56 months  but same.
16083,"with all the bad things, i compare it to possibly getting pregnant and the pros outweigh the cons every time."
16084,heres to at least 6 years
16085,im sorry you had to go through that!
16086,ive had providers try to push the iud on me too when i told them i wanted the implant.
16087,such a weird thing!
16088,and being sexually active definitely does not soften the blow of iud insertion  big yikes
16089,"unfortunately she didnt show it to me, just described it /"
16090,Mine were metal rods in varying widths to help dilate the cervix yes
16091,I have a pretty high pain tolerance most of the time.
16092,I has big tears coming out of my eyes during the insertion.
16093,Going to work the next day and pretending my lower abdomen wasnt on fire was NOT fun.
16094,Absolutely awful I agree!
16095,But I far prefer having an IUD then not having one currently.
16096,You are not alone its just not always required.
16097,Hope you continue to feel better and the cramps continue to subside!
16098,Thank you for posting about it as it helps add to the picture!
16099,"First appointment wasn't too bad because she literally couldn't get past the muscle at all, so just some discomfort."
16100,"I had planned ahead and had a friend drive me, but when that one was a bust, I didn't want to bother her again, so I took the bus the second time."
16101,Getting a ride would definitely have been better.
16102,I didn't get any snacks either!
16103,"The person assisting did hold my hand though, which was nice I guess."
16104,I told that doctor before that I had a small cervix.
16105,I previously had 1 failed insertion with a different doctor and then one insertion where she measured my uterus to 6cm but then that iud fell out.
16106,The whole appointment was 10 mins in and out and she knew what she was doing but speculums hurt me due to ptsd of sexual assault so I get like panic attacks.
16107,She gave me lorazepam but when she saw my cervix she went wow small hole.
16108,Yeah I wasnt lying.
16109,Next time Im requesting cytotec its the pill that helps you dilate instead of the rods.
16110,She measured me at 7cm and Ive had mirena for 5.5 years.
16111,I cant take estrogen due to migraines with aura and adding the estrogen increases my risk of a stroke.
16112,Mini pills never helped my periods theyre very heavy ling and painful and mirena helps.
16113,Depo shot made me gain 60 pounds in 6 months and I heard Nexplanon has similar side effects as depo.
16114,So at the time mirena was my last option.
16115,But it stopped my periods after 6 months which has been a life saver for me since my periods make me not ba able to walk for 2 days and 7 days of not being able to function each month.
16116,Only issue now is my pms is coming back.
16117,Ive had sore boobs for a week and no Im not pregnant.
16118,I use the cheaper tests off Amazon its the same stuff you buy in stores just not name brand with huge plastic around it.
16119,I got like 100 for 18 clinic guard brand and I take one every few months.
16120,So debating getting it replaced early even though mirena is approved to prevent pregnancy for 8 years now.
16121,Now theres also a new mini pill but I could have side effects with that for 3 months.
16122,I moved across the country so Id have to find a new doctor.Sorry this was long.
16123,"yeah i honestly didn't agree with that statement whatsoever, and it confused me more because she said her primary interest was in birth control."
16124,"i imagine it may be easier after having a /child/, not after having a sex"
16125,Shit that looks so fuckin painful to experience im so sorry that you had to go through that
16126,that has to be brutal  oooof i am sorry
16127,thank you!
16128,and same here.
16129,the pain sucked but id do it again for another at least 6 years childfree
16130,"ah, gotcha."
16131,"and public transit after that, god youre strong."
16132,i think i wouldve screamed at every pothole those buses always seem to hit!
16133,the bag only had 4 tiny cookies so you didnt miss much lol but it was only the NP in the room with me (i made my fianc waited in the car).
16134,but i put 1 airpod in to listen to my favorite song through it so luckily i had my phone in one hand and my airpod case in the other to squeeze through the pain
16135,"One anecdote here  mine were all fine before kids and after having a kid, no difference in experience."
16136,In contrast the implant removal was horribly painful (for me) and I would never ever do that again!
16137,Thanks.
16138,Yeah I commented my experience in my original comment to OP.
16139,I either have to go thru that again in 3 years or try the new mini pill thats out and risk possible weight gain after I got all that weight off from other meds.
16140,I mean I could also not gain weight.
16141,Hard decision
16142,"i had my implant removed and replaced on Monday, it was completely painless."
16143,and i was so nervous about it
16144,Hello )I (24F) have taken tricyclen birth control tablets since I was 15.
16145,"I stopped taking any form of birth control last year for about a year, and decided to restart a few months ago."
16146,"Im taking trijordyna (which I was told was the same as tricyclen just rebranded) and for the very first time in my life, I have horrific cystic acne."
16147,Ive never dealt with this before.
16148,I read that this can be normal when starting birth control but its been 4 months or so and my skin has never been worse.
16149,Could it be from my birth control?
16150,Any recommendations?
16151,Thank you!
16152,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.
16153,Questions?
16154,"First read the Mistake or Pregnancy Risk sticky( or the Consolidated Experience post( If this is an experience post please consider adding it to the listPlanned Parenthood online chat(The rules and additional resources can be found on the About / Sidepage (desktop users look to the right and Reddit app up top).I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
16155,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
16156,So I have been on birth control since July due to irregular periods and have been on an emotional rollercoaster sadly.
16157,"I started with Lo Loestrin Fe and within 2 weeks i was breaking out terribly with hormonal acne, extreme mood swings, soreness, and fatigue."
16158,I went back to the doctors and explained my issues so I was switched onto Ortho Tri Cyclen which I started after i finished my first pack of the Lo Loestrin.
16159,"My face started to clear up and I was feeling a lot better when I was on the sugar pills and the first week of the Ortho Tri Cyclen, but once again I am almost three weeks into the new birth control and Im feeling all the same symptoms I did before."
16160,"I hear that it can take 36 months for your body to start to regulate your hormones on birth control, but I dont know if I should wait it out or switch the type of birth control Im on again or just stop taking it."
16161,Has anybody had any similar experiences or have any advice they could give me please?
16162,"I would appreciate any input, thank you so much."
16163,"I would at least make it to 3 months, its very normal to have side effects the first few weeks to months."
16164,If you still are having bad symptoms try non pill methods.
16165,Some people just dont handle pills well.
16166,You should wait at least the 36 months because switching too much to soon or getting off it suddenly can cause a change in hormones that can make things worse for you.
16167,It's possible that the switching is why you are feeling this way.
16168,It's possible that it can go away not certain but it can.
16169,If it doesn't then you can ask to switch or decide to stop taking it.
16170,I was on a few different versions of the pill throughout high school for my heavy periods and it made me feel the same way as you.
16171,Then I got to college and found a new OB that was against pills/depo shots and promoted the implant and IUDs.
16172,I ended up getting Nexplanon (the implant) and honestly it has worked so much better than the pills ever did.
16173,It took about a month or two to even out but since it has been great.
16174,Im due to get it replaced soon so my acne is getting a little more out of control but thats normal towards the end of the three years because the hormones are being secreted by the rod less and less.
16175,Overall I would recommend the implant because it gives peace of mind and dont make people feel unlike themselves while on it.
16176,I took LoLo for 3ish years and it was okay until I got a generic (alovera I believe) and it was HORRIBLE.
16177,"Acne, depression, mood swings, highly emotional, basically every symptom on that stupid pamphlet you get with each pack lol."
16178,I switched to YAZ after looking up the brands proven to treat acne since that was a huge struggle at the time.
16179,I LOVE yaz.
16180,So much that I pay 53/pack for it and will not try any generics after my reaction.
16181,"Moral is if you dont like your symptoms, ask your doctor to switch."
16182,I took the generic for 23 months until I realized that was what caused my issues and I wish I wouldve just stopped taking it until I could switch to a different brand.
16183,"If you want to be on birth control, it may take time to find something that works."
16184,"I honestly love being on the pill because I like knowing when Ill get my period and know Im protected (and clear skin now, yay)."
16185,Hope that helps some!
16186,"It takes at least 3 months for your body to adjust, however, given the symptoms you already have, stop now."
16187,"The symptoms can get milder, but they already sound so bad, that it is not worth it."
16188,"I had those symptoms as well and my social life and part of my academic year got ruined, symptoms didn't get away and no one knew why I was suffering from extreme mood swings."
16189,And I was a hormonal monster so RIP friendships .
16190,"0/10 do not recommend Tey out another combo pill or POP, or ankther method in general."
16191,I also have great experiences with the implant.
16192,"I feel more stable and I don't get any periods, but experiences vary."
16193,"Honestly I would just stop, I was on birth control for 5 years."
16194,"I had all the mood swings (and thats putting it simply) I was fatigued all the time, depressed, bad body image, brain fog etc."
16195,I just got off of it about a week ago and I have suddenly realized that I have no idea what Im actually supposed to feel like or what my body and mental state normally feels like.
16196,I am so excited to get back to feeling like me again.
16197,I tried too long to convince myself that it was working for me and I think I actually have lost a good portion of time to thinking what I was feeling was OK and not actually just BC side effects.
16198,"If its not working, its not working."
16199,"BC can be a very good thing but it also doesnt work for many women, especially if you are sensitive to hormones.This is just a short version of my experience, there is much more."
16200,But I encourage you to keep doing research and seeking out advice in order to form your own opinions!
16201,!Best of luck on your journey!
16202,!
16203,I like lutera (lowest dose)
16204,I completely feel you!!
16205,When I first started bc my doc put me on Lolo.
16206,Super low dose just to get used to it.
16207,and let me tell u it was A ROLLERCOASTER!
16208,Not only was I severely bloated the whole 89 months I was on it but gained a bunch of weight cause of my horrible anxiety/depression and my mood swings yikesss!
16209,My doc told me to stick it out as it takes time for the body to adjust to the hormones and so I did.
16210,I then experienced like a 910 period and my period symptoms came back worse so then my doc switched then switched to Marvelon 28 and everything went away with a day or so.Unfortunately its a trial and error process.
16211,I do suggest sticking it out as it does take 14 months for your body to adjust to the hormones.I hope you find the right fit soon
16212,"Personally, I would stop."
16213,I had nexplanon in my arm for like 5 years.
16214,"Caused me to have long periods, wait gain, mood swings, etc."
16215,I switched to the pill(sprintec) and within a month I started feeling weird so I got checked.
16216,Everything seemed okay.
16217,6 months later I turn 21 and now I randomly have issues with high blood pressure which is no joke.
16218,I was in the ER with stroke level BP.
16219,They told me to get off of the birth control and then 6 months later (more recently) my neurologist said it was from the birth control.
16220,Took forever for my BP to go down to normal levels and I started going to the acupuncturist for it as well.
16221,Id just stop.
16222,Its terrible for you.

16227,"I found out also after 3 month the side effect are a lot less on different forms of birth control, some of the body likes more some of the body likes less."
16228,I agree.
16229,I agree if the symptoms are bad now they likely wont improve but you can try a different pill.
16230,Its not worth battling the symptoms for 3 months.
16231,Youll find something that works eventually even if you dont choose to stay on the pill
16232,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge."
16233,"okay so this is my last year with nexplanon, I had since i was around 16."
16234,I am now about to turn 19 in December and I have to get the nexplanon removed this February.
16235,(just turned 16 like two months  Prior to getting it) but anyways to get to the point me and my boyfriend yk and he did cum inside me and it's been about 2 to 3 weeks.
16236,"and since then my boobs are sore but I cant tell if their bigger, I have mild cramps but I'm constantly nauseous even before all this so that's normal to me but for some my armpits hurt, and I been shitting so much more then usually."
16237,and for some reason the bottom of my eyebrows sting??.
16238,"like the boob thing is kinda normal because of  hormones but it's worse then usually and I dont shit this often at all,so I dont know if this is fs hormones or what."
16239,"please help and either make me paranoid to get a test or tell me I'm dumb ass and give me  robotic voice ""nexplanon is almost 99 percent effective"" rant."
16240,"Nexplanon isnt almost 99 effective, its almost 100."
16241,Its 99.95 effective over a entire year.
16242,Nexplanon can cause most of these side effects.
16243,"New studies have also found that it is effective for 5 years, not 3."
16244,"If youre worried, theres no harm in taking a test."
16245,If your symptoms are from pregnancy itll be positive.
16246,and also been colder then usually but I can't tell if I just been reading too much reddit and is now  Projecting that onto myself

16259,Okay so I know that youre protected for the 47 days youre on the placebo pills assuming youve taken the full packet beforehand.
16260,But my doc tells me that if I spot I should start the placebos no matter where I am in the pack.
16261,Im worried that if I start the placebos in a weird spot I wont be covered.
16262,Ive taken about a packet and a half of active atm (I tried to skip) and now Im spotting so should I take placebo?
16263,"Im just worried like whats the difference between missing a pill and taking the placebos, really?"
16264,"youre right that if you start taking the placebos before you take a full active pack, you are not protected."
16265,once youve taken at least a full pack of active pills you can take the placebos any time.
16266,so yes you can take the placebos now if you have taken a pack and a half of actives!

16277,"However i really don't have the time for that right now, between classes, and moving to another city.My question is  has anyone been in this situation before, and do you think i can take my pill as usual (and combine it with a condom for a while if i see my boyfriend)?TLDR  Missed mini pill 4 days, can i take as normal (only for PCOS)"

16306,"The strings are absolutely hell and my doctor did not even set up a follow up date (did not like the practice although the doctor was okay, I had another doctor offer to do it so I am planning to set up an appointment there asap) which I find very odd."
16307,"I do have atrophy and only just got estradiol cream so I think it might could help, but the timeframe to do so could be rough.I have the Liletta and I did see in my notes the strings were cut to 3cm 1.1 inch, and to me self measuring it seemed to be closer to 3 inches so I am absolutely getting it checked, but not sure what to do if everything is in fact okay."
16308,"I know you should wait at least a few weeks, preferably 36 months to decide to take it out, but I seriously want to rip it out myself off and on and do not think that's very safe, especially if it is misplaced."
16309,I am also unsure if it is misplaced if I try to replace it or if the strings would still be shitty and I am super lost on what to do.
16310,"I just want a reliable BC that I don't have to do much with and has low side effects, I feel my only other choice is nuvaring but considering I can't even make a female condom stay in I don't think my anatomy would work well with it (and is probably why the strings are aweful for my iud)."
16311,I also would have liked a nonhormonal option (I did not go with that due to heavy bleeding risk and already regret it to be fair though) and don't see a better option than a full hysto but do not have the time off I would need.
16312,Your iud will adjust to your body besides resting you cant do much and if you feel that its misplaced go to an obgyn its way to risky if you try to put it in the right place yourself!

16314,It should never be causing any issues in the vagina itself unless its halfway out.
16315,If youre feeling pain in your cervix its probably from the trauma of the insertion.

16343,My first birth control pill is Blisovi Fe and Im currently taking the 3rd packet.
16344,Ive experienced nausea during the first two days of starting a new pack (this is the main reason I wanted to switch pills).
16345,The nausea would make me lightheaded and unable to be upright.
16346,"Other than that Ive experience more bloating but not painful, and although Ive always struggled with my skin Ive been getting more acne despite consistently using tretinoin for the past 10 months."
16347,"Ive also been a little more moody, feel a slight decrease in sex drive, and had increased anxiety during the beginning months."
16348,"Some good side effects I experienced are no more period cramps and no more painful tender breasts.My doctor prescribed me Nikki to help with my acne and hopefully with the nausea, but after doing some google searches I saw that theres a lawsuit against Nikki for causing blood clots and other health conditions.. and Im kind of scared especially bc I get headaches often."
16349,I know that all birth control pills will have some health risks but seeing that theres a large lawsuit against Nikki is making me nervous to make the switch.
16350,"I honestly feel like I can ride out the side effects of Blisovi, especially if having headaches may increase the likelihood of getting blood clots.I wanted to know if anyone else has had experience with either or both pills and which they prefer?"
16351,"Prior to taking birth control, my period was pretty regular and I tracked ovulation to prevent pregnancy but I was also quite anxious about not using a more researched birth control method so decided to get on the pill."
16352,"Im thinking about talking to my doctor again about which pill I should continue with but just wanted to hear some testimonials first, thanks!"

16358,"Ive had my IUD (Kyleena) since 2020, but suddenly I am bleeding every 2 weeks!"
16359,"I havent had a period since I was 14, so buying pads was so depressing."
16360,"I finally made an appointment with a gyno to check that things are okay, but Im scared."
16361,Im scared either my IUD has shifted out of place or that they will want to remove it all together and thus the flood gates will open.
16362,I dont know who I am off BC.
16363,I had to quit so many sports and activities as a young teen because of my severe bleeding and cramps.
16364,But theres a part of me that wants to know if I would be less depressed.
16365,"Ive had a depression diagnosis since the age of 9, but I don't know if BC has made it worse over the years either."
16366,Ive also struggled crazy with my weight wondering if BC has been part of it!
16367,"Getting off just makes me nervous my menorrhagia will come back full force.Sorry that this is a lot, Im just frustrated and scared."
16368,Im getting married soon and dont wanna screw myself.
16369,Trying to understand whats going on with my body and why my body hates me.
16370,The dose released by Kyleena (and other hormonal IUDs) decreases over time.
16371,"It stays high enough to prevent pregnancy for 5 years, but the change in dose can cause changes in side effects."
16372,Its not a sign that anything is wrong!
16373,You can replace your IUD early to return to the higher original dose if youd like.Its impossible to say whether youd still have menorrhagia if you stopped birth control.

16388,I use a period tracking app to time out my birth control and track bleeding.
16389,I started using nuvaring this year after terminating an unwanted pregnancy.
16390,"I am having inconsistent bleeding, nasty black discharge, and ""backne"" for the first time ever since starting."
16391,I've read online that bleeding on a new hormonal BC could be normal.
16392,I've mentioned these symptoms to my doctor twice already but I'm not sure she know what to do to help.....she said to insert a new one every 3 weeks from now on to see if it goes away.
16393,"I can't take depo, dr won't put me on the patch because I have a high bmi (29), and I'm worried that I am not willing to have an implant inserted."
16394,I'll detail the bleeding below since I can't share images.
16395,"I inserted my first ring on 5/8/23, changed it out on 6/6/23, and 6/29/23."
16396,Two days after the 3rd ring insertion I started bleeding for the time and bled for 15 days straight.
16397,"I changed my ring on 7/25/23, 17 days later (on 8/11/23) I started bleeding again and bled for another 15 days straight."
16398,I changed the ring on 8/22/23 while bleeding.
16399,I then started bleeding AGAIN 9/4/23 and with the exception of a day I am still bleeding today 9/12/23.
16400,"Some days it is spotting that can be managed with panty liners, other days it is very much period like flow."
16401,"Bright red blood, thick black discharge, and grainy like substance when passing blood in the toilet."

16407,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
16408,I don't think you should be concerned per se as it's of course just spotting due to the hormones.
16409,"Should you stay on the ring, though?Your call."
16410,"People told me the same thing when I was on it but honestly... the constant spotting of just over a month, plus extreme lethargy and moodiness almost destroyed the relationship I was in at the time, on top of making me feel like absolute crap."
16411,I ditched the ring and almost immediately felt better!
16412,(got on bcp shortly after.
16413,"I've been on Yasmin, Yaz, Zarrah and Lolo, all of which worked well and the short period of time I was on the ring was by far the worst fwiw)"
16414,It's possible that the ring's estrogen dose is too low to control bleeding for you.
16415,Switching to a combined pill with more estrogen could help.
16416,What could be causing the bleeding for me that other don't have?
16417,I can't find a clear answer on that.
16418,When I wasn't on BC I had a consistent period so bleeding all the time is confusing
16419,"I have been taking Yaz for about a year now and have gained 40 pounds, gone from a size 8/10 to size 14, M to L/XL, and up a cup size since starting it."
16420,In that time I have also transitioned from being a full time college student to being a full time office employee.
16421,Is weight gain a typical side effect with Yaz of could it be environmental factors?
16422,Ive also been actively trying to lose weight (caloric deficit) for a month now and if anything have gained weight.

16478,"You should wait at least 7 days, not because it wont be effective, it was actually recently approved as emergency contraception."

16489,"although im sure youd be fine today, it doesnt hurt to just wait."
16490,use a condom until the two days are past and try not to bath.
16491,its to prevent infection or rejection
16492,Ok thats what I thought.
16493,Im so scared of infection so Ill probably wait like 10 days
16494,Thank you.
16495,Ill definitely wait 7 days maybe a little longer just in case.
16496,But most places do seem to say 7 days.
16497,Same.
16498,I think like birth control wise its ok the same day but its just the infection risk.
16499,But yeah everything says something different
16500,Thank you.
16501,"Ill wait 7 days, honestly probably a little longer just in case."
16502,Im def worried about infection but Ill keep sticking to showers for a bit longer.
16503,"She didnt say anything about infection though or baths or anything, Ive actually never heard that until this thread."
16504,But I got mine at my 6 week pp appointment sooo maybe thats why since she checked me for healing and all that
16505,That could be why.
16506,"It also seems like some doctors say its fine to have sex, use tampons, and take baths right away."
16507,I think some doctors just air on the side of caution with infection risk.
16508,My doctor didnt mention any of this I just remember it partially from my first iud.
16509,Im pretty sure she said 7 days then but honestly I could be wrong.
16510,"Mine definitely is a stickler about infections, she was adamant I wait the 6 weeks to have sex and I told her no problem cause she said it like right after I had my baby and I had stitches lol so I feel like she would have definitely mentioned it!"
16511,"Im sure theres reasons, I know if you havent had a baby they open your cervix and I didnt have to have that cause mine was still slightly opened."
16512,So maybe thats another reason why?
16513,I think that could definitely be a reason.
16514,Ive never given birth but I cant imagine wanting to have sex before six weeks haha
16515,Dude Ive heard of people showing up to their 6 week pp appointment pregnant like how?
16516,Oh my god I couldnt imagine.
16517,The pain and trauma from giving birth and then the sleep deprivation of a kid?

16521,Well its not just that its a huge infection risk and yeah youre bleeding a lot so i do not understand lol
16522,"Hello UK Resident here,In October I'm planning on getting the contraceptive implant for the first time and I'm a bit nervous and wondered if I could have some questions answered I'm currently on rigvedon contraceptive pill so would I need to stop taking this first before I can get the implant?."
16523,If so how long do I need to be off the pill for?
16524,Once I stop taking the pill I'll likely get my period which usually lasts up to 10 days can I get the implant on my period?
16525,It has to be October for me because that's when my partner is on annual leave and ill need someone with me for support.
16526,Any help will be appreciatedThanks
16527,Dont stop taking your birth control!
16528,Its actually recommended to keep taking it for the first 7 days after the implant is inserted so your protection never lapses.

16533,Hello!
16534,I had my mirena  IUD placed around may 2022 I didnt go to the follow up.
16535,Today I went for my annual and told the Gyno about it.
16536,When she was doing the exam she could not find the strings and sent me for an ultrasound.
16537,Is this normal?
16538,Im not sure if I should do it since I havent had any alarming symptoms and I dont think insurance will cover the ultrasound.
16539,Any thoughts?
16540,How much did you have to pay for this?
16541,Im in AZThank you!
16542,!
16543,You definitely should especially since you didnt do a follow up when you first got it.
16544,That follow up was to make sure it was in place.
16545,If they cant find the strings it could potentially be out of place or have fallen out.
16546,Both of which will make it ineffective.

16555,I had always bled monthly during the placebo week.
16556,"Recently (since early February), I stopped withdrawal bleeding (I think it qualifies as amenorrhea)?Ive gone through endless pregnancy tests and saw a doctor, who insisted it was normal after prolonged BC use (especially since my BMI is under 19  Im short, half Asian, and have chronic nausea/gastro issues)."

16565,ive been on the pill for 5 years and a few months ago i pretty much missed a withdrawal bleed.
16566,it can happen
16567,Thanks for the response.
16568,"Im aware that its normal to miss A withdrawal bleed, however is it normal to miss ALL withdrawal bleeds??"
16569,My last one must have been early February
16570,deleted
16571,"Yes, it can be normal!"
16572,Missing 2 withdrawal bleeds is a reason to take a pregnancy test (like you did) but thats it.
16573,I hear you.
16574,"But I miss EVERY withdrawal bleed, not just one."
16575,I havent bled or spotted at ALL since early February.. do you still think thats normal?
16576,So I quit taking my birth control 8 days ago.
16577,I no longer agree with the birth control industry and what it does to your body.
16578,But in the last 4 days Ive lost 5lbs and noticed my appetite has decreased significantly.
16579,Anyone else experience this?
16580,"the weight loss is likely water weight, which is often highly retained through the pill."

16596,7 days.
16597,As long as you've taken correctly.
16598,Thank you
16599,Please keep in mind though that the 99 effectiveness completely relies on YOU taking it correctly and even then there is still a very small chance of pregnancy.
16600,At 18 years old I wouldnt want to take that risk and would still be using a condom.
16601,2 forms of protection is better than one.
16602,Especially if you live in a place that doesnt protect abortions.
16603,Im 32 and have been with partner for 9 years.
16604,Only a few years ago we stopped using 2 forms of protection and then this last year we decided we trusted the pill and our communication if I was late taking it.
16605,We stopped having him pull out and have been fine but I am religious about taking it and tellHim immediately if Im late(doesnt happen often) and he knows at this point that means we need to be safe for a week.
16606,But thats just my opinion.
16607,You will make the best decision for you and your partner though.
16608,Good luck
16609,"Ive been taking Nortrel 7/7/7 for 5 years, but somehow its gotten changed to Alaycen 7/7/7 a few months ago."
16610,They seem to have the same amount of the active ingredient.
16611,However I never had any issues taking the other for 5 years.
16612,"Since taking this one since July I have been having severe mood swings, acne breakouts, and have gained 20 lbs despite a positive lifestyle change and doing everything in my power to lose weight."
16613,Has anyone else taken this pill and experienced something similar?
16614,And why could that be given that both pills should be roughly the same since they can be substituted for each other at the pharmacy?

16629,"Thats crazy because the exact same thing happened to me, where I couldnt start my new pack on time due to Labor Day, and had to start a day late."
16630,"I think in this case its definitely a good idea to take the Plan B, as you likely dont have the full protection from the birth control yet !"
16631,Ive taken 45
16632,Then you need plan b
16633,Reread your post.
16634,Youre not protected at all if you skipped a bunch of pills.
16635,You need to take all the pills in a pack to be protected during the placebo week.
16636,And you need a Plan B right now as well.

16642,"However, today I have had ovulationlike CM, VERY slippery and stretchy, and quite a bit of it, so anxiety is creepin'."
16643,"I don't recall ever having CM like this unless I'm ovulating, but then again haven't ever really tracked it very well since I didn't think my husband's swimmers swam anymore until our BFP last October."
16644,I'm on day 25 of my cycle (second cycle since baby arrived) and before I got pregnant had a ridiculously regular cycle of 28 days.
16645,"Is clear, thin, stretchy CM completey normal for right before your period?"
16646,Or do I need to start mentally preparing myself for the possibility of another pregnancy?
16647,Facepalm
16648,Unprotected sex always poses a risk of pregnancy.
16649,"If youre not tracking and confirming ovulation properly, there is no way to know when you ovulate."
16650,Discharge alone is not enough confirmation.
16651,Take a test 1421 days after sex if your period doesnt show.
16652,"It's common for periods to be irregular postpartum, especially if you're also breastfeeding, so you could ovulate late even if you're normally  regular."
16653,"The mucus you saw might not really be fertile CM, but there is a possibility."
16654,You can still take emergency contraception if you want to.
16655,"IUDs are the most effective method because they work even if you just ovulated, usually the copper IUD is the one used for EC but some places might also offer Mirena/Liletta based on new research."
16656,They can be inserted up to 5 days after sex.
16657,"Emergency contraceptive pills won't work if you already ovulated, but it can take around 2 days for the body to ovulate after fertile CM appears."
16658,"Ella (ulipristal acetate) remains effective closer to ovulation than Plan B /levonorgestrel, but the manufacturer recommends that people don't brestfeed for a week after taking it."

16681,"Ive been on it for 8 months now, and while Ive spotted before a period before this is different."
16682,I took a test today and it said negative.

16684,Can I trust the test results?
16685,Does anyone know whats going on?
16686,Has anyone experienced this??
16687,Im freaking out
16688,Implantation bleeding would not last 9 days.
16689,It really isnt even noticeable if it DOES happen.
16690,Dont let google scare you.
16691,What youre having is just a side effect from your patch.

16703,I will be taking another on Sunday to make sure
16704,Side effects can come and go at any time!
16705,Ive been on the pill for 8 years and still have random things crop up.
16706,"At 12 days the negative is likely accurate, but just for peace of mind Id test again at 14 or after."
16707,Use the first urine of the day and try to stick with a pink dye test if you can.
16708,Thank you so much!

16735,"If it was one small edge that you carefully covered maybe it wouldnt aid in adhesion, but you need to ensure its not holding your patch on at all."
16736,"I would not tape down more than a single side, as taping down more than that would artificially hold the patch on."
16737,Planned Parenthood( and every set of instructions Ive seen for the patch clearly state to not use any adhesive assistant.
16738,The patch has to fully stick to your skin alone.
16739,If the patch is coming off your skin its not adhering well.
16740,Sorry If it sounds as though I'm being difficult.
16741,I am a little slow sometimes.
16742,Thank you for the added advice
16743,Its no problem.
16744,You might be able to test what sides would be safe to loosely tape down using a piece of paper.
16745,"I would personally advise against taping it at all, but thats really up to your digression."
16746,This is one of the reasons I opted to not go for the patch as I was worried it would fall off easily.
16747,F24Almost 3 years ago I started birth control for the first time.
16748,Pills.
16749,After only a few weeks I totally lost sensation down there.
16750,I could get wet and horny.
16751,"But it was a struggle to orgasm, and the orgasm was super weak and very often not worth the struggle."
16752,"I usually had very high sex drive, I came super easy and were very sensitive and so on."
16753,But then it felt like I had no clit or no vagina.
16754,It felt dead.
16755,And this made me depressed because sex with my partner felt so incomplete.
16756,Even with my self it was hopeless.
16757,"I know sex is not everything in the world, but I lost one of my most important senses and it made me so sad."
16758,I didn't even complete one tray of pills and there were maybe 4 trays.
16759,"Never used birth control with hormones since, and I never ever will again."
16760,I went to a gyn specialst.
16761,She had never heard of this kind of situation before.
16762,And she gave some sort of explanation about what she thought.
16763,(Kind of complicated) but overall she said I must have been very extremely sensitive  to these hormones and were sure I would be back to normal after 5 months.But it took almost 2 years since my feelings down there approved a tiny tiny bit.
16764,And this year it is a little better.
16765,But it is still not the same as it was.
16766,But I really hope it will come back to normal again.
16767,Have you ever experienced the same ???
16768,What did you do and did you get back to normal?
16769,I know no one that has experienced this..
16770,Medications are crazy and they mess with your body in so many ways.
16771,I used to be on zoloft for depression but I was having the same problems as you.
16772,The orgasm wasnt worth the struggle and i felt kind of numb.
16773,I changed medications and that helped!
16774,"However, I hopped on the birth control train about 5 years ago (nexplanon and now pills) and I have less of a sex drive and sex isnt as pleasurable."
16775,I am so sorry that you have been feeling this way even after you got off the pill!
16776,I understand how you feel and I wish there were more warnings about side effects.
16777,Maybe you can ask to get your hormones checked to make sure everything is balanced.
16778,I wish I had more advice for you  Just know you arent alone!
16779,I have the same thing happening but not from bc.
16780,I used and still use the diane 35 bc and had no problems on it.
16781,I use it because I have alopecia.
16782,"Since I tried a hair medication named fin, I lost sensation just like you."
16783,"Hope me remaining on the bc is not going to affect my recovery because this is horrible.But you know, if you dont give your body any more artificial hormones, Im sure youll be okay in the end."
16784,Make sure to live as healthy as you can
16785,I switched to copper IUD and its amazing for this reason

16800,Yeah I did too back then.
16801,But now I'm not using anything because I'm not with my partner anymore
16802,So you lost sensation too?
16803,For how long ?
16804,On Friday AM and Sunday AM my boyfriend and I had sex all with fresh condoms.
16805,Turns out they were latex free which Ive heard can break easily and lead to unintended pregnancy.
16806,I take Sprintec and just started my third pack on Sunday night.
16807,Is there a big risk here?
16808,Did the condoms break?
16809,It doesnt matter if theyre more likely to break if they didnt.
16810,Besides youre protected by your pill if youre taking it correctly
16811,I've been on Trisprintec for years and never used condoms with my husband and never gotten pregnant.
16812,tri lo sprintec and tri lo estarllya are the best brands in my opinion.

16814,be careful I was on sprintec for a short time and it caused me to have high blood pressure.

16834,"So I (ftm) have a huge fear of pregnancy to the point it gets somewhat irrational, and my partner doesn't like to use condoms (and I don't either) so I have a nexplanon."
16835,I saw a post somewhere recently about someone getting pregnant on nexplanon and I mentioned it to my sister who said I need to start using condoms because there's always a chance and I might get an STD/STI but my partner and I have both been tested and had the discussion that if somehow something slipped through the tests and we passed it to each other we wouldn't care because no matter what it is it's never a death sentence.
16836,My sister keeps insisting it's the only way to be safe and that I might get pregnant or get an STD if I don't so I wanted some more opinions.
16837,It is one of the most effective contraception methods so if both of you have been tested for STDs and are exclusive there is no reason to use a condom (other than a mental aspect of it  you feeling more safe).
16838,"Nexplanon is up there with sterilization in terms of effectiveness, it is made with the intention of no pull out or no condoms."
16839,"Pregnancies on it are very rare, and either result in a miscarry or ectopic when they do happen, rare occasions would it be a viable pregnancy."
16840,"however they are stupidly rare.Most of the time pregnancies on nexplanon happen because the dang thing never even got into the arm, so more of mechanical error or medical error on that front.You are very protected with it, I have friends who are on it who dont use condoms with it with their boyfriends and no pregnancies on their end."
16841,And I personally am gonna switch to it whenever I get the chance to because IUDs scare the shit out of me.As long as you can feel it in your arm you are protected
16842,Nexplanon has similar failure rates as tubal litigation.
16843,Most common way for nexplanon to fail is for it to migrate in the body.
16844,As long as you can feel it in the arm you should be covered.
16845,If you're in a monogamous relationship and don't mind the clean up there is no reason to use condoms.
16846,"(Unless you want to, some people like how they feel)Nexplanon lasts between 35 years depending on what country you are in recommendations."
16847,Some countries have moved to a 5 year window.
16848,Others are keeping the original 3 year window of effectiveness.
16849,Your comment that you need to wait 6 years makes no sense.
16850,"Nexplanon will work just as effectively if you are not in a monogamous relationship as it does at preventing pregnancy in a couple married for 10 years.Your sister is implying she believes your partner will cheat on you, you will cheat on your partner or you will be a victim of sexual assault."
16851,"I had the nexoplanon for 3 years, never wore a condom, never got pregnant"
16852,It is the most effective bc available.
16853,3x more effective than sterilization according to the CDC.
16854,It's extremely effective on it's own.
16855,"I've personally never known anyone to get pregnant with it, including myself lol."
16856,"Obviously there are always rare random cases of people who get unlucky, so if you feel more comfortable combining it with pull out or something then do that."
16857,But it is one of the most reliable forms of birth control )
16858,Had it since February and it has worked really good without pulling out or condoms.
16859,As long as it's where it's supposed to be in the arm you're good.
16860,Just had a slight weight gain and more hormonal than usual periods.
16861,"Its 99 effective but just keep in mind that all forms of birth control can fail, even a tubal ligation."
16862,ive had it for 3 years now  i've never used a condom during that time.
16863,no pregnancies!
16864,Literally boyfriend finishes me everytime weve had sex for three years just nexplanon no baby obviouslyEdit i would recommend checking to make sure bar is still there exactly were it was out in and perfectly straight at least once a month
16865,For me it was.
16866,I slipped up once and didnt use one with a FWB and then we just went without a few times.
16867,I didnt use them at all after I got tested and met my now fianc.
16868,I switched to a pill bc nexplanon made me walking demon with the worst mood swings and weight gain.
16869,It is very effective however many people taking Nexplanon report an increase in bleeding which in trans individual is said in many circumstances to increase dysphoric thoughts and feelings.
16870,If thats not an issue youd best double up on one hormonal contraception and one barrier for the most reliable way to avoid pregnancy you could also add in cycle tracking to avoid further risk.
16871,In terms of methods for bleeding and effectiveness the Mirena coil is probably the most effective for stopping bleeding and preventing pregnancy (still recommend double/triple contraception methods and tools) however with the Mirena the insertion can be extremely traumatic for some people.
16872,SOURCE former sexual health/contraceptives healthcare worker but it is well researched and I have been a Mirena user.EDIT also I do want to explain that the implant is extremely effective in general but only slightly less than the Mirena its barely a difference in terms of  but what I mean is that the Mirena is consistently more likely to stop bleeding if bleeding is an issue for OP.
16873,Im not trying to convince anyone to use the Mirena over the implant.
16874,I realised I sounded unclear.

16879,She said it wasn't safe to do that until we've been together 6 years so I was super confused tysm
16880,Is it the progesterone that makes an ectopic likely when a pregnancy does occur?
16881,Im thinking it needs to be hormone related since unlike a copper or hormonal iud its not sitting in the uterus.
16882,Can you link sources?
16883,Thank you so much for the info I appreciate it so much!!
16884,The six year part was for STDs because she said it was the only time it would be safe to be unprotected from them which was confusing to me
16885,It's more like 99.99 effective.
16886,There's been like maybe 10 cases in the last decade in the entire world of nexplanon failing.
16887,Usually due to the implant migrating to another part of the body.
16888,Nexplanon is actually slightly more effective than Mirena and the other IUDs.
16889,IUDs are still super effective I think Mirena is usually put at 99.8 and Nexplanon at 99.95 for the one year statistic.
16890,"Nexplanon does have a higher incidence of irregular bleeding for sure though, still usually reduces bleeding amount overall and stops it entirely for some people (not me though).Edit to add a reliable source document BC Efficacy Chart("
16891,I've had nexplanon for over 5 years.
16892,I've had maybe a dozen or so periods in the time frame.
16893,I usually have 1 or so a year.
16894,Hormonal birth control is very much a your mileage may vary situation.
16895,I know people who bled constantly on mirena.
16896,Also I know like 3 people who had their IUD get dislodged.
16897,And the only way to check placement is a trans vaginal ultrasound.
16898,I much prefer just touching my arm to check if it is in the correct position.
16899,1/3 of people report an increase in bleeding.
16900,1/3 report a decrease.
16901,and 1/3 report cessation of bleeding entirely.
16902,"so considering it's equally as likely as bleeding less and not bleeding at all, keep that in mind when you're telling someone ""many people report increase in bleeding"""
16903,That's marriage shit she is talking about.
16904,It has nothing to do with birth control
16905,"Its in the risks of the site itself actually, like on the nexplanon site that it has a slightly higher chance of ectopic pregnancy like here(While Im not sure myself if it is more because of its progesterone only, however it is a thing that is on the site itself.However the chances of it happening are still astronomically small in the grand scheme of things."
16906,First you gotta get pregnant on it and thats the hard part
16907,That's such a weird number.
16908,And you can go on the relationship subreddits and find posts about marriages of over 10 years falling apart from cheating.
16909,There's no need to wait 6 years to be protected from STIs.
16910,"For every STI, there is a window period after sex in which someone might be infected but tests will still be negative."
16911,"The window period varies depending on the specific STI and the test used, but it lasts up to 3 months with modern tests, and 6 months with older tests for some STIs So if you or your partner got tested soon after having had sex with someone else, you might need to get tested again."
16912,But you certainly don't need to wait years.
16913,"I think your sister might have heard that STI tests are only reliable if you've been monogamous for 6 months (as it used to be with older tests) and misunderstood it as ""6 years""."
16914,"Well based off my former knowledge (admittedly a long time ago) they are always pretty much in the same category of effectiveness with both of them pretty much coming in at 99.5 and this was 201415 so thats probably changed but it definitely stands the the Mirena is most likely to stop bleeding other than the pill/combined pill whereas nexplanon, the hormonal ring/patch etc."
16915,which tend to have more reports of sporadic bleeding/spotting for people hence why I personally would suggest the Mirena for the issue of bleeding but really its down to personal choice like I say because the potential for increased in dysphoria symptoms )
16916,you don't have periods on nexplanon.
16917,any bleeds are breakthrough bleeding.
16918,I was also kinda thinking something similar because we are monogamous and have future plans to get married I don't see how being together for six years is the only time it's safe to be unprotected because we've both been tested
16919,"Right, they are absolutely two of the most effective methods one can use currently!"
16920,I was just correcting that it's actually Mirena that is slightly less effective than Nexplanon is all and I agreed about the bleeding issues.
16921,"I used to have a handy chart that showed each of the methods stats with regards to stopping bleeding, I will have to see if I can track it down again.Edit Not the same exact chart but a great ACOG article( with charts showing pros, cons, and approximate stats for menstrual suppression for most if not all methods."
16922,Hello everybody.
16923,"I have a doubt about the effectiveness of birth control in my case So, I have suffered from ipotalamic amenorrhea for the last 3 months due to weight loss, so I went to my gynecologist who, after checking my hormone levels (low estrogen), prescribed me the combo pill for 21days to try to ""unblock"" the situation."
16924,"I started it the 8th of Sept. Now, my question is since I have low hormone levels to begin with, is the pill effective in my case as a contraceptive method?"
16925,And after how many days?
16926,I have never been on bc so I am not used to this kind of info...
16927,The other question is after how many days have you started noticing some kind of side effects?
16928,Info  what did I not ask the doctor these question?
16929,"Honestly, I forgot."
16930,"I was more focused about my diagnosis and the following steps, was thinking about using the situation for ""fun times"" I am at a normal BMI and i follow the direction of a nutritionist, I lost about 15kg (33lb)."
16931,is the pill effective in my case as a contraceptive method?Yes.
16932,"It would be effective after a full 7 days, or when you've taken the 8th pill in the pack."
16933,"Yes, the pill would still be effective against pregnancy, but the bigger concern is that it is not an effective treatment for hypothalamic amenorrhea and your doctor is prescribing it to you against clinical practice guidelines for this condition."
16934,"See the Endocrine Society's report( 3.2 In adolescents and women with FHA, we recommend correcting the energy imbalance to improve hypothalamicpituitaryovarian (HPO) axis function this often requires behavioral change."
16935,"Options for improving energy balance include increased caloric consumption, and/or improved nutrition, and/or decreased exercise activity."
16936,This often requires weight gain.
16937,3.4 We suggest against patients with FHA using oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the sole purpose of regaining menses or improving BMD.

16974,"I had 22 pills instead of 21, I'm sure this is fine but please confirm with me to soothe my paranoia lol..I started my break after that extra pill, but then took a 3day break instead of my usual 7day."
16975,"I know this is also fine but please confirm here too hah..I had sex and let him finish in me 6 or 7 days after I finished my break and started taking the pill again.I'm a bit paranoid that this combination of an extra pill and a shorter break will somehow make me less protected, I know it sounds silly.."

17010,Hello all!
17011,"So, I have decided that I wanted to try an iud."
17012,"With research and talking with a few obgyns, I decided on Skyla since it's the smallest and has the lowest hormone dosage."
17013,"I started this back in June, as I initially wanted to be sedated for the procedure since I have PTSD and I wasn't sure how I'd react, but my insurance was never ran and then my obgyn that was going to do it had to cancel due to some personal life stuff and is unable to do it until next January."
17014,"So, I waited and now it's time for my next round of depo and I decided I'd call and see if I could get some antianxiety meds or something and just do it awake to be done with it."
17015,"Friday, I called and the lady was unsure of how exactly to go about scheduling me since I asked about meds, so she wanted a NP to talk with me first, so I had to wait until Monday (yesterday) to talk with someone, but she assured me I should be able to have it put in on the same day I would've gotten my depo (which would be this friday).Yesterday, an NP called me and we talked a bit about the procedure, my fears surrounding it (since it's marked in my chart that I had requested sedation initially) and how I wanted to do this."
17016,"She sends a message off to my obgyn and then towards the end of the day calls me back with the all clear for some valium and they can definitely do the iud insertion whenever, I just have to cancel my depo and schedule it."
17017,"Ok, cool so I called this morning and that's where it started to get annoying for me.I called a little after open to make sure I could get this done before I had to leave for my classes, as I'd be unavailable for the rest of the day until after they closed, and I tell him exactly what I wanted."
17018,"""I need to cancel my depo shot and schedule an iud insertion""."
17019,"He asked me again what I needed, so I repeated myself."
17020,"Then, when he asks which one I wanted, I say Skyla."
17021,"He says ""oh, I don't even know if we use that one."
17022,"Let me check"" and leaves me on hold for about 5 min while he checks."
17023,"Then, he comes back without an answer to whether or not they use Skyla (which I would assume they do, since that's what was recommended to me by one of the obgyns there), so I asked him how long it would be to see one of the obgyns I had spoken with before and he said a few weeks, so I said that I didn't really care if it was one of my obgyns or a NP, I was just hoping to get it done on Friday since that's when my depo was up."
17024,He then tells me that's not possible because my insurance wouldn't have been run by then and that he'd call me back with whether or not they even used Skyla.
17025,Is it this difficult to get an IUD?
17026,"I truly don't really want one to begin with and I'm absolutely terrified, but its really my only option besides a bisalp at this point and the obgyn that recommended the Skyla said they could do that if I wanted, but they preferred if I had tried a LARC first."
17027,I've never had an experience like this with the office before and I just found it weird.
17028,"On Friday, they were ready to give me an IUD Monday or this Friday, but now my insurance will take longer than 4 days to come back with whether or not they'd cover it?"
17029,I'm very confused and want to know am I missing something or was this scheduler just having an off day?
17030,Or maybe I'm just overanalyzing and this is normal?

17044,It's worth a shot.
17045,"Occasionally, people who always start a new pack instead of taking the placebo pills actually bleed more during the month (called breakthrough bleeding)."
17046,This is because the hormone levels in your body stay constantly elevated and your body adjusts to this by breakthrough bleeding more and more often.
17047,Taking the placebo pills every month or every few months allows the hormone levels in your body to drop enough that you may actually bleed less overall.
17048,Hopefully this makes sense this link also has good information about this process ETA This is not to say that you should skip to the placebo pills in the middle of your pack.
17049,"Take the pills in your current pack in order, and then try taking the placebo pills when you reach them."
17050,I got the Kyleena IUD back in Nov 2022 after trying 3 other birth controls and getting over my fear of it.
17051,"For a while, it was going alright."
17052,"Only main symptom I was experiencing was cramping, which sucked for me as Ive never been one to get cramps."
17053,"Then April comes around, I start dating my boyfriend, and we have pretty frequent sex (as in, I had only done this once previously since I got my IUD)."
17054,Since thenI have had yeast twice and BV three times.
17055,"I have done treatments, been cleared, then it flares up again."
17056,Nothing is more annoying to me than having to put those creams up my vagina every day.
17057,And being itchy/smelly.
17058,"Went to my doctor yesterday, and she is pretty positive that my IUD is causing the recurrent infections."
17059,"And now, despite having no symptoms, my cultures came back with BV and Yeast."
17060,"All of this to say, I never knew that this would be a possibility with the IUD."
17061,"I have had yeast and BV once before (back in 2021, at the same time), which is not uncommon to have once in a few years."
17062,But back to back in 6 months is uncalled for and annoying as shit.

17069,Yaz is the 1 medication for my mental health and pmdd.
17070,Nothing else I take comes close in keeping me balanced and not wanting to unalive myself once a month.Been taking it continuously bc the placebo days were bad for my mental health.
17071,I am now seeing a new doctor and I guess she wrote my rx differently and my insurance wont let me refill it every 24 days now.
17072,"Only every 28 which means I have to take placebos.Trying to get in touch with her to see what she can do, if she can write it differently But how bad could this be if I started having regular periods again?"
17073,Going on the continuous use route definitely had side effects until it leveled out so Im worried about something akin to withdrawal symptoms.

17110,For someone on bc without other risk factors its about 0.31 of a higher chance over the course on 10 years.
17111,Its very unlikely unless youre already at risk for blood clots.
17112,So the guy I am seeing and I tried penetration  Unsuccessfully.
17113,He barely got the tip in and never cum.
17114,He was not wearing a condom because we knew penetration was very unlikely (I have vaginismus and I am just starting to SLOWLY get over it) and he has VERY good control.
17115,Today when I got home out of curiosity I checked my period app and it turns out I am in my fertile period.
17116,"Realistically, what are the chances of me getting pregnant from precum?"
17117,"I am telling myself that all things considered chances are low but at the same time, I am freaking out because I might even be ovulating."
17118,Very low but not 0.
17119,Its impossible to calculate an exact risk.
17120,You can always take a test in 21 days to be certain.
17121,If youre going to continue exploring its a good idea to use condoms and/or chat with your doctor about birth control options.
17122,Your doctor could also get you a PT referral to help address the vaginismus if you want that.
17123,While there is a chance.

17217,"My main big concerns that would actually require intervention would be infection and bleeding, but it could very well be your hormones reacting to the removal."
17218,Either way your doctor may be interested in these symptoms and you should at least call the office.
17219,I am also considering having my iud removed.
17220,Was it painful compared to having it inserted or not bad?
17221,Thank you for the reply!!
17222,"Im still not sure if its connected to my hormones, but I ended up with severe vertigo for 5 days which Ive never had before."
17223,"Could be weird timing but Im not sure what caused it, it happened right after my second period ended postIUD."
17224,"It would kind of make sense as my cycle lines up with how long Ive been dizzy.For me, the removal was not as bad as insertion, but I definitely had that deep cramping feeling as it was coming out  just not as harsh as the cramps I had during insertion."
17225,"Also, it was super super quick and the pain was over almost immediately!"
17226,I took some Tylenol beforehand so that couldve helped too!
17227,"Good luck if you do decide to have it removed, and dont be scared it is definitely not as bad as getting it in (at least for me)!"
17228,"Hi everyone, Im new to all of this and I just had my Mirena inserted yesterday afternoon,Ive never been on a BC so I dont really know what to expect in the weeks or months to come."
17229,"For context, Ive always had horrible, passing out, throwing up kind of cramps and my cycle has always been irregular and varied anywhere between 2944 days, with bleeding lasting around 5 days, so I am hoping this will help eventually regulate it."
17230,The actual insertion just felt like a really bad cramp and it was over with in like 2 minutes.
17231,For the rest of the day I had what personally felt to me were 3.5/4 level cramps on a scale of 10.
17232,"I know it is definitely new and not had time to do its thing but i havent had any bleeding or painful cramps yet like I have read that a lot of people experience, should i be expecting that the next couple of days or weeks?"

17251,I know depo is just a higher amount of progestin that I was getting daily on the mini pill but I like not having to remember to take a pill each day.
17252,I do monitor my diet and work out once a week.
17253,I had been on the mini pill for 4 years but switched to depo as I had been taking my pill late recently and experienced some pregnancy scares.
17254,"Due to a medical condition, it is imperative that I do not pregnant right now and I was scared of the invasiveness of the implant or IUD so opted for depo instead."
17255,I don't plan on being on it for more than a year or two due to the bone density issues it can create so I guess eventually I need to get over the fear of an IUD and probably opt into that in the next couple years.

17308,I want to switch to a copper IUD.
17309,The hormones just are not for me.
17310,"However someone told me if your partner is larger than average, he could hit the IUD making it painful for both parties."
17311,I know if I bring this up to a doctor they will go off about how everything stretches.
17312,"But, I complain to him he hits a wall all the time and we have to move positions."
17313,"A bit of a back story I (27F) and my husband (28M) have two babies, a 19 month old  4 month old."
17314,We are not wanting any children in the foreseeable future.
17315,"I havent been on birth control since 2016, I was on Depo Shot (only birth control I ever used since I was 14)."
17316,"But coming off the Depo shot I was psychotic, and I vouched to never use hormonal birth control ever again."
17317,We went YEARS and didnt have a baby until we tried.
17318,But our second baby came as a bit of a surprise.
17319,"I do not want any children at all, at least not for the next 57 years."
17320,If I were to get pregnant Im not sure what Id do.
17321,My mental health couldnt handle it.
17322,So I went on birth control pills.
17323,"They made me nauseous, irritable, and bleed for over 2.5 weeks (still bleeding)."
17324,I called my OBGYN yesterday and told them I want to switch to Copper IUD.
17325,They said I have to be bleeding on my period.
17326,I told them Im still bleeding?
17327,She said no.
17328,Wait for your next period.
17329,So who knows when that could happen?
17330,I left a message for my primary and Im hoping she can do it this week.
17331,"But after someone said it only works if your pArtner is average or smaller, Im thinking it might not work for us."
17332,Leaving me stumped at what to do.

17337,"Your partner should never feel your IUD during sex, its inside your uterus not your vagina."
17338,Theres a chance of them feeling the strings but thats not dangerous.
17339,I have a hormonal IUD and I will say it tooth a few months to feel comfortable with sex like normal because I was worried about something like that happening but it was actually fine.
17340,I (27F) live in the UK where the contraceptive pill is thankfully free.
17341,I've struggled with severe period cramps since I was about 12 and ended up missing a lot of school/work because of it.
17342,"Things improved a bit into my mid20s, but I've had a pretty difficult year and I think as a result of that it's gotten horrendous again, to the point I had to call out of work last month."
17343,I went to the doctor who prescribed me Rigevidon and mefenamic acid (a painkiller).
17344,I had a big dip in my mental health at first but I knew this was normal so I stuck it out and felt better within a couple of weeks.
17345,The doctor told me to keep taking the pill without skipping and my period would either be very light or nonexistent.
17346,"As I approached the week my period was due I had the usual warning signs breaking out, horrible anxiety, digestive issues."
17347,"I tested positive for Covid on Thursday then my period started on Friday which was great timing, but I don't think Covid is known for affecting your period."
17348,"It's now Tuesday and I've been in agony this entire time, only getting limited relief from painkillers and hot water bottles."
17349,Usually the worst pain is the first couple days then it becomes bearable but now it's unrelenting and extremely heavy as well.
17350,I've continued taking the pill throughout.
17351,"I can't find any definitive answers online so I'm just wondering if anyone knows if this is a normal, temporary side effect?"
17352,"If it's temporary and my periods are going to get better in the long run I'll of course stick it out, but if this is going to be the case every month no thank you!!"
17353,"If it's relevent, I don't need the pill for comtraception, it was only prescribed for my periods."
17354,It sounds to me like you have an underlying health condition causing period pain especially since you've been suffering since 12 me too!
17355,I have fibroids and PCOS and suspect I have endometriosis.
17356,Your period should never be more than a mild inconvenience.
17357,Ask your GP to refer you to a gynaecologist so they can do a scan to check for fibroids/cysts.
17358,COVID absolutely made me have a rougher period for sure!
17359,It can take a few months for my pill to stop ovulation so I hope it gets better for you but having suffered since 12 I'd be keen to see what's happening up thereEdit  for clarity

17363,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
17364,"In my case, yes."
17365,I started hormonal BC at 12 too for heavy periods and anemia and it helped for a while.
17366,"But then I noticed that my periods were essentially all mucous, like just red globs."
17367,"So I tried a month off birth control and it was SO much lighter and less painful and the blood was actually fully liquid, with just a few tiny clots.I don't know exactly what the reasoning is, maybe the uterine contractions have to be stronger to expel the mucous?"
17368,"There are methods of birth control that you can skip periods, I use the contraceptive ring and instead of taking it out week 3, I just leave it in until week four and change right to a new ring."
17369,"I have definitely had some pills make my periods/bleeding worse but I have endometriosis, have had fibroids, cysts, etc...so I dunno if that is why or what."
17370,"To me it seems like certain hormone formulations aggravate my endo symptoms, while others help."
17371,I agree you may want to look into whether you might have an underlying condition like that and if things don't improve soon try a different formulation.
17372,"I personally had the best results with progestin only, but I think it is too personal to say that means anything really."
17373,It does not take a few months for the combined pill to stop ovulation.
17374,Thats completely false information.
17375,It's not combined it's drospirenone a progesterone.
17376,Had IUD for 1.5 years now and never had spotting.
17377,All of a sudden Ive been spotting on and off for like two....three weeks between August and September.
17378,I did lose a bunch of weight (eating disorder) and am now trying to gain it back.
17379,"Only mentioning this bc starving used to make me lose my period and then it would come back months later, making me irregular I'm hoping that is what is happening."
17380,"I haven't lost my period this time though, so I basically had two periods in one month / Is my IUD outta place?"
17381,Negative pregnancy test today.

17396,I (18F) got my Liletta IUD placed just over 2 months ago (My first form of hormonal birth control).
17397,"Since then, I have had a 5day period and consistent spotting that only needs a panty liner a day."
17398,I have an appointment scheduled soon at my local office to follow up on the placement of my IUD.
17399,"Overall, since getting my IUD my overall mood and quality of life has improved what I knew to be my period symptoms have gotten better and symptoms I didnt know were related have nearly disappeared.I am not looking for medical advice."
17400,I am not looking to replace my IUD unless necessary.

17407,"Since starting it, my acne has gotten worse and I am having my period about every two weeks.I have heard that you need to wait 34 months for your hormones to level out when starting a new birth control, and I am curious if anyone on the minipill has had experience with similar sideeffects that eventually went away.For added context, I cannot use combo pils due to headaches and cannot use the copper IUD due to menstrual cramps.Thank you in advance for any input or advice."

17411,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
17412,Ive been on the mini pill slynd for about 7 months and have experienced similar effects (mainly acne).
17413,"My acne was HORRIBLE starting out with this pill, and every pimple left scarring which Im still using retinol treatments for."
17414,Overall the acne levelled out however its remained above normal if that makes sense.
17415,"I get more pimples than I did before starting so at this point Im assuming itll remain at this level unless I go off, but its nowhere near as bad as when I first started.Like you, I also have no other options so the acne was a side effect I decided I could deal with compared to more severe effects."
17416,Thankfully I havent experienced any frequent bleeding but if my acne experience gives you any hope both symptoms will more than likely level out eventually!
17417,"Theres also, always an option to switch to a different progestinonly brand and see how you do with that if it doesnt end up levelling out."
17418,"Side effects usually settle after 36 months, but the progestin only pill is pretty known for causing acne so its highly possible that it won't settle."
17419,"I believe the pill you are using contains one of the most androgenic progestins, so I'm not surprised it's causing acne."
17420,You can look into other forms of progestin only pills which are less androgenic.
17421,"Slynd is the only progestin only pill which is actually anti androgenic  I know the other commenter said it caused them acne, and its definitely possible, but every side effect is different for everyone and statistically, its the most likely to help acne rather than cause it."
17422,If no pill works  you could look into the hormonal IUD which is progestin only  supposedly the hormones are localised in your uterus so it can sometimes result in less side effects.
17423,This is not the case for everyone and lots of people still report acne.
17424,Have you tried the copper IUD?
17425,"If you haven't tried it yet, it isn't guaranteed to make menstrual cramps worse, so it might also be worth giving it a second thought."
17426,Depends on the person.
17427,If it doesnt fade then it isnt their bc for you.
17428,"I switched from the combined pill to the mini pill nearly a month ago and since then, Ive basically had a period after every time Ive had sex.The cycle goes like have sex  spotting the day after (no bleeding right after that would suggest tears or dryness)  full blown period that lasts at least 3 days with stomach cramps and general shitty symptoms of hormones acting up  have sex a good few days after the bleeding has stoppedThe bleeding is ONLY triggered by sex."
17429,"When I have the breaks of no sex, I dont spot or anything."
17430,"It genuinely feels exactly like a period so I dont know if the pill is messing with my hormones or if its a cervical thing, etc?Not sure if it could be related but I took plan B a month ago too."

17456,"Has anyone else experienced an IUD pregnancy/near pregnancy, and which IUD were you using?"
17457,"I'm keeping my fingers (and legs, for the moment D) crossed that the higher dose of levonorgestrel will be enough."
17458,"Both skyla and mirena have VERY low chances of pregnancy  you were extremely unlikely to get pregnant on it once, let alone twice."
17459,"Chances of pregnancy with mirena is around 0.2 and skyla 0.4, so it is slightly higher with skyla, but not by much."
17460,Did you discuss the pregnancies with your doctor?
17461,Did they notice if the IUD had slipped out of place or if it was just random?
17462,"Some women are more prone to expulsion of IUDs which could explain why you got pregnant twice  in which case, perhaps a different method is better for you?"

17479,"Hi, my boyfriend and I had a broken condom accident the other month and in turn I had to take emergency contraception."
17480,"Thankfully I was not pregnant (took a test this morning, which marks the 4 weeks after incident)."
17481,"2 weeks after the accident we start having sex again, being extra careful with condoms."
17482,"But whatever I do, I never seem to shake off the anxiety that sperm may simply leak out of the base or the ""rolled"" part of the condom or somehow leak inside."
17483,"The last 2 times we had sex during one of the instances he went soft all of a sudden and I made him remove the condom so there was no ejaculation involved thankfully, and during the other instance I just got major anxiety when I saw whitish fluid around the base of his penis and the sperm (although it was very little to begin with) inside the condom was not gathered at the tip but rather was spread out in the condom."
17484,"I hope you get what I mean, I'm so sick of thinking about every little thing and I know that I may be putting my boyfriend off too."
17485,"I live in a country where spermicide condoms don't exist, and I have no other chance of protection as pills mess me up."
17486,I've been thinking about saving some money with my partner to maybe get an implant or something other that requires a medical setting to implement but it is not a possibility for now.
17487,Please someone tell me that condoms shouldn't be this much overthought (
17488,"The best advise I can give is, make sure he is using the correct size?"
17489,Because a condom with a too large witdh can cause this.
17490,I hope this helps!
17491,"condoms shouldnt be too tight to the point its all he feels and its uncomfortable or too loose that it moves during sex, maybe look the condoms you use online to find a sizing chart."
17492,going soft during sex isnt a super unusual thing and it can happen for a lot of reasons but make sure when it happens that he pulls out instead of trying to get hard again inside because the condom could move.
17493,his sperm not being at the tip of the condom could also be from it being put on incorrectly!
17494,"a small air gap should be left between the tip of his penis and the tip of the condom, most condom boxes will have a lot more information on how to use them printed inside the box (at least where im from)."
17495,ive looked into spermicide condoms and spermicide gels because i have anxiety about condoms aswell and from what i found they usually arent the best to use.
17496,some people dont have a problem with them but it can be very irritating to you or your partner!
17497,if u do buy spermicides online outside of your area research the specific kind to know the pros/cons and possible risks.

17523,I also take Wellbutrin.
17524,"I havent had any bad side effects from any of the pills I tried, I just think its decreased my sex drive a bit and I have always struggled with wetness (Im in a long term relationship since around the time I started the pill) and have always felt insecure despite my partner reassuring me."
17525,So there have been a couple times in the last year where I stopped taking my birth control bc I missed a few days and I felt like I was so much more aroused and wet and horny more often.
17526,I considered iuds but got scared cos of horror stories I heard and read so yeah just continued with the pill.
17527,Im really thinking of getting an IUD again but Im so conflicted.
17528,"I want to try non hormonal to see if my sex drive/arousal improves but other than that, the pill is actually really good and doesnt affect anything else, and regulates my periods which have alwyas been irregular."
17529,I also think I should try something else because sometimes I do forget to take the pill so I should be on something with less maintenance.
17530,"Im not sure if hormonal IUD and the pill affect sex drive in the same way, like would hormonal iud be a good option?"
17531,And my periods too theyre irregular without birth control so will the copper iud really mess up my cycle?
17532,Also Im not even sure if its the birth control or if I just am naturally dry so should I still consider going through the whole process to see?

17541,"If taking a daily pill is not something you're willing/able to do anymore, then it's probably best to switch methods.In regards to bleed regularity, a hormonal IUD won't help."
17542,"Even for someone who has a dependable cycle, it's a random crap shoot once you get on a continuous method."
17543,"Your current pill has a placebo built in to trigger a regular bleed, but a hormonal IUD is a continual dose that slowly decreases with time."
17544,Irregular bleeding is extremely common.
17545,"It might make bleeding lighter or stop altogether, but it could also make it worse and you won't know until you try."
17546,Have you gone hormone free for extended periods of time recently?
17547,A lot of people are irregular in their teens but eventually even out.
17548,I'm just wondering if irregular cycles is still a problem or not.It's possible you could still have lubrication and libido issues on hormonal IUD.
17549,"With copper IUD you might experience more bleeding/cramping, but otherwise it's all your natural state."
17550,I just got the kyleena recent and its the best decision Ive ever made.
17551,"Ive tried the depo shot, several diff brands of the pills, all with horrible side effects and now I dont have heavy ass periods like I used to and I dont even bleed at all anymore I love mine the insertion really hurts though"
17552,ive been using the twirla patch over a year and a half now and i love it.
17553,10/10 experience.
17554,easy to use and no side effects.
17555,its a patch i wear weekly for 3 weeks then skip a week.

17561,I am on the pill and have been for 4 months.
17562,My partner and I use a condom and withdrawal every time we have sex.
17563,I have slight tokophobia and anytime something seems off or theres a small chance semen got inside of me I start freaking out even though Im on the pill.
17564,"The last couple times my partner and I had sex, he would pull out and Id rub him as he was about to finish anyway."
17565,Ive noticed some wet feeling around the base of the condom.
17566,I dont know while hes finishing Im pushing some stuff up that way or if its my juices or even the lube we use but it shouldnt make a difference because he came outside of me and into the condom right?
17567,Nothing around the base was broken or anything and the rest of the condom and even the tip part looked fine and nothing was slipping off during so just this little this is worrying me.
17568,And my partner also felt wet around his pubic hair like above the base part of him and Im assuming that was either the lube or me but Im not sure and my mind is trying to play tricks on me.
17569,These are your own fluids or lube.

17576,Yesterday I started the Evra patches birthcontrol method so that was my first day using it (not the first time tho).
17577,I was on my third day of period when I started using it.
17578,Today my partner and I had a big oops having sex and we don't know if the patches will be still effective.
17579,Should I take the next morning pill?
17580,Maybe I'm just worried and the patches will do their job?Honestly I would love to avoid taking the pill because is a very painful and long process but I don't want to have any surprises.
17581,So youre starting after not being on it for a while?
17582,Youre protected since you put it on within the first 5 days of your period.

17587,Yes it's the first one I use this time.
17588,"So I thought, but in the prospect it says that you are only protected if you put your first patch on the first day of your period, that's why I am that worried.Where did you get the info of the 5 days thing?"
17589,Up to you then.
17590,Use protection if youre unsure about your patch
17591,So Evra and Xulane work exactly the same?
17592,"Im not sure, Im getting a lot of mixed info online."

17594,I had my implanon removed early November 2022 after having it in for just under 5 and a half years.
17595,"Its now been 10 months and I am still without a period, Ive had increased acne and hair growth on my face and chest."
17596,Does anyone know whats going on?
17597,Main reason I came off the implanon is because of the weight gain I experienced whilst it was in.
17598,Since removal I wouldnt say Ive lost weight however it has stayed the same which is the first time its done this since I was a teenager.
17599,Whilst I had the implanon in I was gaining weight steadily for the full time.

17626,My girlfriend got her IUD checked at the doctors a week before I came to visit her.
17627,When we had sex I could feel plastic poking at me.
17628,It felt sharp and it hurt in some positions.
17629,Ive felt the strings before and it didnt feel like the strings.
17630,She tells me not to worry because she just got it checked but I cant help but be scared that her IUD is out of place.
17631,She is hesitant to go back and get it checked.
17632,What should I do?
17633,Is it possible to feel the hard part of the IUD and it not be out of place?
17634,Should she go back and get it checked again?
17635,Keep in mind it does hurt quite a bit to get it checked.
17636,If you feel hard plastic its out of place and needs to be removed because it isnt protecting against pregnancy.
17637,Have her reach in and check.
17638,She shouldnt feel the plastic part at all
17639,Can't she check it herself?
17640,"Unless they're doing an ultrasound, the GYN is doing the same basic string check you can do at home."

17648,"just wanted to give an update, she went and got it checked and it was in place, she got her blood drawn and it was confirmed she is not pregnant (its been almost 3 weeks now since we had sex), as far as the IUD goes we are thinking about getting it removed and switching back to the pill because it did hurt and we are a bit paranoid now that it will move back out of place"
17649,Thats odd.
17650,Are the strings possibly hurting you?
17651,"ive been able to feel the strings since she got it, it was definitely not the strings but i only felt it in certain positions"
17652,Hello.
17653,I started combination pill to alleviate symptoms of my PCOS and start the regulation of my menstruation.
17654,"I am advised to take the combination pill for 6 months and see if there are any improvements on my health.However, since the pill also acts as contraceptive, my bf and I wanted to have pleasurable experience while I am still at the pill."
17655,It's been less than a week since we did the deed and I am experiencing severe to moderate cramps during the day and some discharge.
17656,It was especially bad yesterday.
17657,I am in the 3rd week of my 2nd month's active pills.
17658,I want to trust the pill but I am wondering if my body has not yet adjusted to the pill?
17659,"For context, I bled (light to heavy bleeding like normal period) the whole time during my active pills in the first month."
17660,I take my pills on time and have not missed any dosage yet but should I be worried?

17665,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
17666,"Protection from pregnancy on the pill takes 7 days (8th pill), so as long as you were taking them everyday around the same time you are protected."
17667,Now when it comes to the side effects you are experiencing it could be more of the pcos being a bitch or it could be from the pill itself.Now if you need peace of mind just take a test 14 days after the last encounter with the first morning pee or 21 days after.
17668,More than likely they would be negative because you did have protected sex.Now if the pain continues please let your doctor know about it.
17669,"With the combination pill, you are protected from pregnancy immediately if you start it on the first day of your period, or after 7 days of continuously taking it."
17670,You have been protected from pregnancy for a long time now if you have been taking it consistently.
17671,The 6 months is how long it can take for side effects to subside  not how long it takes to work.
17672,"Side effects such as bleeding etc are very common in the first 36 months, if it doesn't stop after 3 then I would advise to speak to your doctor about changing the type of pill you take."
17673,You should also ask them for some advice as to how to use the pill as a contraceptive.
17674,Went to the Ob/Gyn this morning to get my Paragard taken out.
17675,"An arm broke off upon removal (surprise, surprise!)."
17676,My doctor tried to grab the arm but I was covered in sweat and hurting so she said shed prefer to try a hysteroscopy with general anesthesia for me.
17677,I got home and started looking into insurance.
17678,Turns out that having a hysteroscopy (I assume with local anesthesia) in an office setting will be 60 while a hysteroscopy with general anesthesia will be 3000.
17679,Has anyone had a hysteroscopy with local anesthesia and can you tell me how it went?
17680,Was it painful?
17681,Was it quick?
17682,"I want to see if I can get my doctor (or another doctor) to save me 2,940So many doctors never consider cost and it is so annoying!"
17683,p.s.
17684,already reached out to a law firm for a free consultation because im so mad at Paragard that this has happened to sooooooooo many people.
17685,I had an IUD removal with general anesthesia and after several attempts to have it removed in office I will NEVER allow someone to insert anything through my cervix while I'm conscious ever again.
17686,"I would call around to other offices, and work with your insurance to see if there's maybe a different office that it could possibly be cheaper at."
17687,"Some women say that hysteroscopy is not super painful but I knew from my IUD insertions that it would be, as that's basically the same procedure."
17688,If you ultimately do decide to just do the local anesthesia I would advocate for some type of stronger pain killer or some type of anti anxiety/muscle relaxer.
17689,And a cervix softener.

17693,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
17694,"So even with local anesthesia to numb your cervix, there is still pain?"
17695,?
17696,"Also im confused, did you have a hysteroscopy in office before the one with general anesthesia or no?"
17697,I can't speak to that part but if you look around this sub you will see plenty of iud insertion stories where local was used and it seems like a toss up of if that actually helped or not.
17698,Some people say it helped a ton and was basically painless and others say it didn't help at all and was worse due to the injection of local.
17699,That's why I'd recommend also asking for some type of cervix softener as well as some type of anti anxiety medication which most gynecologists are willing to prescribe for procedures like this.
17700,"No, just normal removal attempts with the alligator clamps."
17701,A hysteroscopy is just a camera being inserted through your cervix.
17702,"If you had an awful insertion, or it was really painful when they tried to remove the broken arm of the paragard then you will likely have similar sensations during the hysteroscopy."
17703,Right  I understand what a hysteroscopy is but thats without any kind of local anesthesia/cervix softener.
17704,"So it sounds like Im going to be requesting those things to see if I can just do the hysteroscopy in office, rather than doing one with general anesthesia."
17705,Some (most) of us just dont have the privilege of spending 3k on surgery.
17706,Hi!
17707,So Ive been on depo for about 4/5 months now and Im hating every minute of it.
17708,1st injection was ok and didnt bleed at all until the 2nd month and then the 3rd month and then got the 2nd injection (nurse told me it would ease off the bleeding and other symptoms) and Ive now been bleeding heavily for about 4/5 months whilst being on it.
17709,As well as continuously bleeding my mental health has taken a complete downhill trip.
17710,To the point where I think I may admit myself to a psych ward bc of how mentally unwell Ive been these last couple months.
17711,I just miss my old self and how happy I was and its starting to effect everyone who I love around me too ( luckily I just have under 2 months for this thing to stop going awol in my body which will hopefully mean Ill feel ok in the next couple of months.
17712,I really do wished it worked for me how it did for others but I guess thats just the way of life eh!

17718,I am about to be 37 and have recently got back on the depo in the last year.
17719,I do not bleed at all.
17720,I took it in my early 20's for a couple years and I didn't bleed then either.
17721,"My sister was the opposite and bled nonstop, so she stopped getting it."
17722,I don't remember ever having mood swings or feeling irritable back then.
17723,I guess I am starting to notice recently that I am.
17724,I also just read on another post someone saying that it is the most hated form of birth control.
17725,I'm curious as to why?
17726,This might seem like a bit of a weird question but after seeing so many stories on here about changing BC methods I kinda got into my own head a little.
17727,"I've been on Monofeme (a combo pill) for a little over a year now, but when refilling my script today the pharmacist gave me the generic version, Eleanor."
17728,"I know they have the same active ingredients, but are made up of different nonactive ingredients."
17729,Will this be ok?
17730,Is there a possibility that I could get different side effects compared to the namebrand version?Thanks in advance!
17731,It will be fine.
17732,This happens to millions of women.
17733,"This also happens all the time with many other prescription medications, but people just arent aware because they come in a bottle without any branding."
17734,People get more in their heads about it with birth control because they can see the package change.
17735,"Unless you have an allergy to a nonactive ingredient (think artificial dyes and sweeteners, though I dont even think most birth control pills have these), the odds of you experiencing a reaction are slim to none."
17736,It will be fine.
17737,I have been switched to different generic brands multiple times in a row and now difference.
17738,Some people have mild side effects if the brand is different but usually its not much.
17739,But if it bothers you your doctor can prescribe it so its x brand only.

17749,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
17750,Peeing does not affect absorption.If you vomitted then you'd potentially throw the pill up before you absorbed it.
17751,Same with diarrhoea except from the other end.
17752,The digestive processes relies on time to absorb nutrients into the bloodstream.
17753,Anything that speeds up the process can result in stuff not getting absorbed.Eg this is the reason people get pregnant with stomach issues as the pill can just potentially travel through without fully working.Urinating expels waste products that have been filtered out by your kidneys (urea).
17754,Birth control will not be affected by this.Just a side question do you have anxiety?
17755,"No judgment, just asking."
17756,Thanks for this.
17757,Yes slight anxiety.
17758,"The only bodily functions that can affect the pill is ass blasting, holding onto the counter, might need a seatbelt so you dont blast off, praying to all the deities, gonna need a shower after, food poisoning like diarrhea.Or vomiting before 2 hours after taking your pill.Urinating does not affect it."
17759,Youre okay.
17760,"I ran out of birth control (triphasic) which I use for my endometriosis and acne, and will be starting it a week late.... massively paranoid."
17761,I already have cramps.
17762,What do I do?
17763,Just start the whole pack like normal?
17764,Freaking out terribly
17765,"Just start the pack like normal and continue taking it, if need be let your doctor know about it so that way they can help you make a plan about where to go from here, but take them as directed"
17766,"Ive been on Kyleena for about a month now and Ive never had cramps so often and so bad before, is this normal and will it ever go away?"
17767,Cramps are normal after insertion but they shouldnt be unbearable.
17768,Have they checked placement since its been a month since insertion?
17769,I know I had cramps and tenderness for several weeks followed by the occasional really sharp one from time to time.

17774,I had Kyleena for nearly two years.
17775,I had cramps at every ovulation and very often after sex.
17776,Finally I decided to ask my doctor to remove it.
17777,"This is what I have now, random sharp cramps."
17778,"as the title says, i started taking combination pills a week ago (yay no more pregnancy scares)."
17779,i'm not exactly sure if i should be expecting to feel side effects now so when or what should i realistically expect?
17780,"I mean it is different for everyone, for me it was mostly mood wise, I got so mad I wanted to flip a table because I couldnt find a Tupperware lid."
17781,"But it isnt all the time that I felt like that, but I noticed my emotions were amplified during the first month or two.I also had hot flashes on occasion, which was good during the winter but kinda sucked ass during the summer."
17782,But once again everyone is different
17783,So my gf is currently with me here in America since she lives in Germany originally.
17784,"No surprise to anyone here, the healthcare here sucks as compared to Europe."
17785,Shes currently an au pair so even going to places likes urgent care is hella expensive.
17786,She made an appointment with planned parenthood and they went to charge her 164!!
17787,"For anyone who knows anything about au pairs, they make 4/hr."
17788,And I want to help but money is also tight on my end at the moment but Ill fork up the cash if thats what she wants.
17789,I brought up using condoms again but she wants to see if a delivery service is worth it first.
17790,Is wisp realible?
17791,Is it shady?
17792,Where can we get affordable birth control?
17793,"I never tried wisp, but I went through GoodRX when Simple Health discontinued."
17794,I tried the 30 day free trial for the gold membership and paid 19.99 for a contraceptive consultation.
17795,"Afterwards, I chose to have my script scent to my local pharmacy of choice and I just pay their pharmacy pricing."
17796,"Once I picked up my first fill, I canceled the free trial membership."
17797,I used Wisp a month ago.
17798,The positives fast.
17799,Easy.
17800,Cheap for a plan B (Ellaone)Negative Wisp sent over the script ASAP.
17801,Pharmacy got it same day at 9am.
17802,However they didn't have the Ellaone that I was prescribed and it had to be shipped there plus it was a Friday.
17803,They didn't get my medication in until Monday at 7pm.
17804,Talk about to close for comfort.
17805,"If you go to CVS, its 40 for a 3 month supply with no insurance."
17806,They do the prescription instore and it takes 20 minutes max.
17807,I had to do that when I got laid off and it was pretty painless.
17808,Ive used Wisp for a few months and so far so good  the turnaround time from when my prescription was renewed to when it was shipped and delivered was quick.
17809,I havent had to reach out with any questions so I dont know how fast they are with responses.
17810,I went from Nurx to Wisp a few months ago.
17811,Nurx was horrible with customer service and delayed my prescription for weeks.
17812,Wisp saved me and was able to send the prescription to CVS in less than 24 hours.
17813,So Id recommend.
17814,"I've never used Wisp but there are many telehealth options out there, hopefully someone can give input on Wisp specifically."

17836,"I have the 28 oral that contains two hormones, norgestimate (a progestin) and ethinyl estradiol (an estrogen)."
17837,I just finished the colored pills.
17838,And Im on the white pill week.
17839,Last week I had sore boobs.
17840,The pain from it was mostly on the side of my boobs.
17841,Is that normal?
17842,They felt heavier but that feeling has gone away.
17843,I also wanted to ask if the white pill week means period week?
17844,Is this week truly your period ?
17845,Does it confirm your not pregnant?
17846,I literally dont know anything  i was prescribed the pills for my cysts but I was a walk in so my doc didnt really explain much.
17847,She told me nothing basically.
17848,The only other side effect Ive been feeling is a little nausea.
17849,But what can i expect from this kind of BC?this would be my first pack and my second day of the white pills

17854,Im on the same pill and have been for over 2 years.
17855,I still occasionally have same side effects.
17856,The white pills are the placebos and is when youll have your withdrawal bleed.
17857,When I first started Id get the withdrawal bleed on the 3rd day of the placebos.
17858,Now its sometimes the 4th.
17859,Its also entirely possible to not have bleeding since one of the way the pill works is to thin the uterine lining and sometimes theres just nothing left to shed.
17860,Regardless of when/if you bleed make sure to start your next pack on time or your protection will lapse.
17861,For me its common to still have light bleeding until the 2nd or 3rd pill of the new pack.
17862,Regarding pregnancy confirmation Ive read some conflicting statements since its not a true period but basically its still your uterus shedding its lining which is not compatible with pregnancy.
17863,I usually take it as a sign of not being pregnant but if its a month where maybe it was a little lighter or shorter than normal Ill take a test just to confirm (accurate 2 weeks after sex and definitive after 3).
17864,Hope this helps!
17865,ive been on tri lo estarylla (same family as tri lo sprintec) for years and i still get occasional breat pain and other hormonal symptoms randomly.
17866,the nausea is completely normal and will subside eventually.
17867,"you may also get bloating, headaches, and temporary acne."
17868,you may also feel a little moody for a bit.
17869,bascially any PMS symptoms but slightly more amplified.
17870,"the placebo week technically doesn't confirm pregnancy since its not a real period, its just a withdrawal bleed (i actually didnt even know this until like 4 years of taking the pill lol, finding that out terrified me)."
17871,"just make sure you take the pill at the same time everyday, or at least within the same 3 hour window (for example, if you take it at 7pm but cant take it at exactly 7 because theres something going on that day, you can take it any time between 68pm and still be protected)."
17872,"if you miss a pill, take it as soon as you remember."
17873,"if you don't remember until its time to take your next pill, take that pill and the one you missed the day prior."
17874,im honestly still not sure what to do if you throw up/have diarrhea after taking the pill so id google that lol.
17875,NEVER leave your pills in a hot/cold car.
17876,the pack should have a temperature range mentioned on it somewhere.
17877,always check if any of ur meds/supplements interact with the effectiveness.
17878,i think thats about it
17879,Does anyone have any experience with going from Microgynon to the mini pill?
17880,Im thinking of changing due to the higher risk of blood clots over the age of 30.
17881,Ive been on Microgynon for 10 years and I dont remember my body off of it.

17901,thank you
17902,"Hi, yesterday I had unprotected sex (did pull out)and I am on a Progesestrone only birth control pill."
17903,I have been taking it on time and took it on time yesterday as well.
17904,However today I accidentally took it at 1148pm when I am supposed to take it at 8pm.
17905,Do I or should I take a plan b in the morning tomorrow?
17906,Would it be too late anyways?
17907,I also know that the mini pill has a window of 3 hours but im not sure if that applies here
17908,Mini pills usually have a two or three hour window depending on the brand and type.
17909,Read your pamphlet on what to do when you are late with a pill and it should have the instructions.
17910,Usually it is take the pill when you remember and take the next one at the normal time if it is within the timeframe.
17911,After the timeframe though is when it would be more of an emergency situation and you would need to take a plan b and wear condoms for 3 days
17912,i would recommend looking into twirla its a patch you wear weekly for 3 weeks then off for 1 week its much easier to keep up with then a pill but to answer your question youre fine
17913,"Hello, I would say you could be OK but its not worth the risk if pregnancy is not on your agenda at the minute."
17914,"From experience, I have taken Plan B and I knew I might have not needed it but for me personally, I wasnt in a position to be pregnant ( financially) so for me, it was worth the peace of mind."

17920,"oh that sounds amazing ill definitely check it out, thanks!"
17921,Every method of BC affects everyone differently  you will not have the same side effects as others.
17922,"In addition, the patch is a combined for of contraception, whereas your pill is progestin only, so there are even more likely to be different side effects."
17923,Not everyone can take estrogen either which is another thing to consider.
17924,"You can certainly look into it, but if your pill is not causing you side effects then it might be best to stick with that."
17925,Longer term progestin only methods include the IUD and the implant.
17926,"These are progestin only but again, even these could affect you differently especially when its a different type of progestin"
17927,youre welcome ive been using it over a year and a half and never had any problems or side effects
17928,And it works like normal birth control?
17929,"Does it make your periods lighter, that is one of the main reasons i am on BC to begin with"
17930,yes and it does personally for me it makes my periods 3 days long then 23 days spotting and its monthly no months skipped and comes during/around the off week and is gone by the time you start the next patch
17931,oh sweet!
17932,"sorry one more question, does it ever like want to come off?"
17933,with showering or sweat?
17934,ask plenty of questions im here to answer and ive only had an issue doing that when i went swimming for a long time but everyday sweats and showers dont do a single thing they stick very well
17935,I recently stopped using the nuvaring because of all the side effects and because I hated the way it made me feel.
17936,"That being said, Im also a little sketched out by condoms (dont ask lol)."
17937,I was looking into the cooper iud but it seems like even non hormonal birth control methods still mess with your body!!
17938,Any advice?
17939,Or do I just have to go with the lesser of the evils?
17940,"copper IUD dont affect your hormones at all, but any birth control will in some way affect your body except for condoms."
17941,"Copper IUD is truly probably the best way to go if youre not ok with accidentally getting pregnant, every other method has significantly lower efficacy."
17942,"There are things like Spermicide and cervical caps, those are much less effective and meant to be combined with condoms or other things"
17943,"It depends what you mean by ""mess with your body""."
17944,"The copper IUD does make your periods heavier, but it has zero systemic effects on the rest of you (minus people with copper storage defects)."
17945,"The copper IUD doesnt mess with your body  other than the possibility of a heavier period / having a natural period, but most find it perfectly fine to use."
17946,Remember most women do not want a natural cycle / heavier flow and instead want hormonal methods / light flow as natural periods really suck.
17947,But every method will have a negative review or two.
17948,"Why?Your absolute favorite restaurant, Im sure someone hates."
17949,See why reviews are only sort of helpful?
17950,As someone will absolutely hate what you absolutely love.
17951,Theres no such thing as a lesser of evils  a birth control I love (copper IUD) someone else hates.
17952,"Pick what works best for you and see how it goes   the copper IUD made my periods heavier and more painful, but only for about 68 months."
17953,"The last year Ive been back to my normal painless periods, but still a little heavier than usual."
17954, Copper IUD is truly the only extremely effective nonhormonal birth control option (other than tubes tied) it is over 99 effective and does not effect ovulation or hormones at all.
17955,I got one in 2022 and I love it!
17956,"It lasts for up to 10 years and when you remove it, fertility goes back to normal immediately!"
17957,It was an all around win win for me.
17958,Just educate yourself on the insertion process first to make sure you are up for it/okay with it.
17959,"There is one by brand name Saheli (ormeloxifene) that I believe is non hormonal or at least doesnt contain progesterone or estrogen, Im not sure how it works and its only available in some countries"
17960,What country are you in?
17961,I used a Caya diaphragm and Contragel until it became impossible to get here in the US.
17962,"Not the most convenient system, or great for spontaneity, but I would absolutely go back to it if I could."
17963,"There's fertility awareness methods (actual methods, no apps or calendar guesstimates), cervical cap/diaphragm, and spermicide (caya gel and contragel are nonirritating and nonoxynol9 free)."
17964,Depending on your risk aversion you can also combine methods with pullout.
17965,hey!
17966,i was in this position last year.
17967,"after a lot of health issues i had to come off of all  any HBC, leaving me with very few options."
17968,i looked into the copper coil but as im severely anemic it wasnt a good option for me.
17969,"i currently use a mix of condoms and Natural Cycles, but im extra safe with it the way the app is meant to be used is by using a condom / abstaining during red days, and having unprotected sex during green days."
17970,however i find this too risky so i use NC to track my cycle and i abstain from PIV sex completely during my ovulation window.
17971,the rest of the time (on the green days) i still use a condom.
17972,"so basically i do not have vaginal sex during my fertile window, and when i do have sex, its during my non fertile days and i still use a condom."
17973,i also take a test every month for peace of mind.
17974,ive been doing this for a year now and its the best thing ive ever done.
17975,"it sounds like a lot but when you dont have any other choice, you have to do what you can"
17976,pregnancy will mess with your body way more than any form if birth control.
17977,"I use the temp / discharge measurement method, worked great for 2 years now."

17994,Thank you so much Ive been stressing  it sounds like a mix of methods is the way to go for sure
17995,It's not an either or situation.
17996,I'm on my second one now and love it.
17997,"Dont listen to the horror stories, the success stories never get as much attention!"
17998,Ive had my paragard for 5 years and overall very happy
17999,I've had mine for a year now and somehow my periods haven't even gotten heavier?
18000,Main downside is the cramping for the first 23 months as I had it.

18005,Sensiplan and TCOYF use this but afaik Sensiplan is supposed to be simpler.
18006,This site has some info on different methods to see if/what appeals to you and what you might want to research further )
18007,"no worries, glad it helped."
18008,honestly no method is perfect and you just need to work out whats best for you.
18009,a mix of methods is always handy.

18013,thanks
18014,Thank you very much!
18015,"You don't have to be regular to use fertility awareness, it's not the calendar/rhythm method so it doesn't assume ovulation is the same every month, it only confirms when ovulation is over."
18016,"Any nonhormonal methods are automatically more work, but they are also sideeffect free as a tradeoff."
18017,"Hey all, I have never been on this sub in my life lol (throwaway account cause main gets too much attention to feel comfortable posting from there)So basically I've been single and abstinent by choice for the last 5 years."
18018,"About three months ago I got into a really, really great relationship and wanted to get on birth control for probably obvious reasons.Problem is that I have bipolar disorder and no insurance."
18019,I make decent income so can generally afford things like Telehealth visits and medication with a discount pharmacy card but all of this is very new to navigate for me.
18020,"I did a bunch of research and came to the conclusion that I probably wanted to go for the progestinonly pill if it was an option, spent 60ish to do a virtual appointment with a nurse practitioner and found out that since I take Lamotrigine and estrogen can make that less effective, it's against their policy to prescribe any kind of hormonal birth control over Telehealth (even if you're trying to get the estrogenfree kind, they just have a blanket rule against prescribing hormonal anything."
18021,)I'm honestly not sure what to do here because I know that something like a copper IUD would be an option but that is 100 unaffordable to me.
18022,"Currently using condoms which is okay and boyfriend is fine with continuing to do that but I don't know, I just want to be able to get on birth control and just feel really sad and discouraged with the current development."
18023,I could afford spending probably up to like 100 on a Telehealth visit through a different provider or possibly an inperson visit at some kind of lowcost clinic but I'm just really scared of spending that money and then just being told that they can't help again.Does anyone here have experience with this or any kind of advice?

18043,Ive been on birth control for about 8 years since I was a junior in high school (Im now 25).
18044,Ive only ever taken pills and have been on seasonale/seasonique generic for last 3 years or so.
18045,It works well for me.
18046,I have a diagnosis of vestibular migraines that typically make me feel dizzy/vertigo spells  I see my neurologist and he is aware of this.
18047,Today I was in class and started to see a bright spot in my vision that was shimmering.
18048,It was most similar to how your eyes look after a camera flash goes off or staring into a bright light.
18049,I thought maybe the overhead lights or screen was triggering a vestibular episode so I went to the bathroom where it was much more dim but the spot wouldnt go away and got progressively worse.
18050,I did some quick googling and assumed it may be an aura so I took tylonel right away.
18051,The aura disappeared after about an hour or so but I had a throbbing headache after.
18052,"I took a nap and woke up and most symptoms were gone.All of this being said, Im obviously concerned as Im on the pill."
18053,"I went to my annual GYN visit a few weeks ago and when chatting about migraines, she made me ensure I wasnt experiencing aura with my typical episodes."
18054,I know this can increase your risk for stroke so Im a bit nervous.
18055,I reached out to my GYN but shes out of office for the week and the nurse there wasnt helpful and said to just call my neurologist and its up to me whether or not to take my pills.
18056,Im wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation and what they would do.
18057,"Im obviously leaning towards stopping my pills for at least the week and checking in with my Dr when shes back, but figured Id ask here in the meantime."
18058,Im a clinical student and have seen young patients recovering from stroke due to birth control so Im kind of feeling a bit anxious over it.
18059,Any/all help is appreciated )
18060,Call your neurologist asap.
18061,And then follow up with gyn next week.
18062,"Migraines  aura are no joke when it comes to birth control, thats why I went with a copper IUD since I have a history of them."

18068,Im 24 and just got my second Paraguard IUD after a big oops with my boyfriend (needed a reliable form of birth control after the condom came off one night and then broke the next.)
18069,"My first IUD was also the copper Paraguard and while it worked great the first 23 years, the last 2 I had it in for was a constant cycle of yeast infections and UTIs."
18070,"The yeast infections (or BV as I was later diagnosed with) was manageable, but the constant dysuria in my bladder was what really made me go get it removed."
18071,I could not stand constantly feeling like I needed to pee and then have my bladder hurt and burn after sex.
18072,Most of the time when I went into urgent care thinking I had another UTI it turned out to be nothing but my bladder just being upset and irritated.
18073,"A couple times it was actually a UTI, but generally just discomfort and always feeling like I had to go to the bathroom."
18074,"since I got the first one out, my bladder has returned to normal, and it didnt hurt anymore and I didnt get any more UTIs or symptoms of UTIs."
18075,These infections one away as well.
18076,My dilemma is that I had to get the second ParaGard because I needed a form of emergency contraceptive that I could trust and while everything was kosher for the first month of me getting it in (just normal IUD insertion pains) The second month is really trying me.
18077,About a week ago I started to feel that bladder discomfort that I had felt with the prior IUD.
18078,"Im not sure if its because my cervix is really close to my bladder and its possibly bumping and pushing when I have intercourse or because I do have another yeast infection and thats irritating my urethra.mostly, I would like to know if anybody else has experienced this with a ParaGard IUD or any IUD."
18079,What did you do about it?
18080,Is there something I can take to make myself feel better?
18081,Is there something I need to be doing after sex?
18082,"not to be gross, but I wipe front to back, and I use flushable wipes to keep everything clean down there as well as pee before and after sex."
18083,I also drink a lot of water to keep my bladder flushed out and healthy.
18084,"I go to the restroom when I know forsure I need to go, and never strain to pee."
18085,I dont wanna have to get this IUD removed because it was expensive and I really do enjoy how low maintenance it is and that its not hormonal.
18086,But the bladder incontinence is killing me.
18087,happened to me too!
18088,i tried to keep the iud in as long as i could but it just kept getting worse.
18089,got better after a few months of having it out.
18090,I had frequent infections with my paragards which developed into pain during intercourse.
18091,Eventually my body halfexpelled my second IUD and I ended up with long term chronic pelvic floor pain and having to see a pelvic floor therapist which has been very expensive.
18092,"My pvt told me that my body didn't like having a foreign object shoved up there, unfortunately, it can be a great option if it works but for some of us we can't will our bodies to be okay with it."
18093,There is also evidence bacteria and yeast can stick to IUD strings although this hasn't been widely studied.
18094,"If it's not working for you, then it's best to listen to your body."
18095,"There are other nonhormonal methods like fertility awareness (no apps/calendar guesses), cervical cap/diaphragm, spermicide, and pullout and condoms can be used in conjunction with these methods for high efficacy."

18100,"I never had this with an IUD, but I did have the same thing with a pill."
18101,It took a while for it to eventually stop.
18102,But I feel your pain.
18103,im sorry to hear that but Im glad Im not alone!
18104,"Thanks for responding) I do think my body doesnt like the IUD, which does suck."
18105,I told myself Id give it another 2 months and if it doesnt feel better by then Im having it removed.
18106,"I dont want to go through an expulsion or perforation because it doesnt sit right in me, and youre right, the consequences could be expensive."
18107,"I have used a diaphragm and tracked my natural cycle but both give me anxiety before my period comes because I know I cant be on spot 100 of the time with it, thats just nature."
18108,Im a natural worrier and sometimes the anxiety is too much to handle.
18109,"Really wish they made birth control for men other than condoms too (what a dream, haha.)"
18110,But thanks for the advice its nice to know some other people are experiencing kinda what I am because I get little to no answers from googling things and even my doctors.
18111,I feel like they never fully got to the bottom of the problem with my first IUD or even offered me options on finding out why it causes issues.
18112,Just keep it and deal or get it removed.
18113,"I like giving things I paid lots of money for a shot, ya know?"
18114,"Diaphragms are meh by themself, there's caya gel and contragel which are nonirritating spermicides that are supposed to add a lot of efficacy and help suction the device to the cervix."
18115,"Also, you can track your natural cycle but I assume you were using apps?"
18116,"Fertility awareness methods can effectively be used to track your cycle but you have to track symptoms daily and such, if you wanted to pursue that in future.Lol I paid 80 for my IUDs, most expensive mistake I ever made  doctors can really suck for women's health care unfortunately."
18117,"I just started my period today, and I dont plan on starting my next pack."
18118,Ive been on birth control since I was 19 (24 now) and the first two years were great.
18119,"I had no side effects, everything was fine, until one day the birth control I was using just stopped working."
18120,"Ive gone through about 4 different pills, and this current pill Ive been taking, Junel FE 1.5/30 has been so rough."
18121,"The first 6ish months were fine, and then these last 5 cycles have been absolutely awful."
18122,"This past cycle in particular, I got absolute horrible PMS symptoms 12 days before my period started."
18123,"Im talking like severe anxiety/panic, depression (Ive never experienced depression before in my life), brain fog, dissociation, and just this sense of impending doom."
18124,Its been so fucking awful.
18125,Ive been wanting to stop taking the pill for a while and this period pushed me over the edge.
18126,My periods were always fine before birth control.
18127,"Id get some PMS 3 days prior to my period, and it would end when my period ended."
18128,Nothing super bad or debilitating like this.Any advice/things to look out for once my period ends?
18129,"I feel like absolute trash right now and Im looking forward to see what will change once I get off of this pill, but Im also kinda nervous for it."
18130,"I know it varies from person to person, but any stories, things to watch out for, would be super helpful."
18131,Hi!!
18132,"I was in the exact same boat, went on at 18, now 23, went off it about 8 months ago."
18133,"For me looking back my moods definitely shifted, I feel so much happier and just more alive right now."
18134,And I got a real libido back!
18135,"I will say my cycles are still not regular, my last cycle was about 6 weeks long which is kind of a pain in the ass for tracking purposes."
18136,I think a lot of people dont have quite that long of an adjustment period.
18137,The one bad thing has been my skin sadly.
18138,"I started getting hormonal acne about two months after going off, it peaked around four months and has been steadily getting better, thanks to my dermatologist and skin regimen."
18139,"I know that part sounds scary, but if I could do it over again, I still would get off the pill."
18140,"My moods are just so much better, I feel much more like myself, and just like a cloud has lifted off of me."
18141,Good luck!

18148,"Thats exactly why I wanna get off of it, its messing with me mentally so bad."
18149,I didnt take my pill today so I feel like Im being vigilant in watching out for symptoms LOL
18150,When i first started birth control (combined pill) my libido wasnt affected at all.
18151,"I had no issue with being sexually attracted to my boyfriend, and we had sex regularly."
18152,"However, in the last few months any feeling i had towards sex has disappeared completely."
18153,"I like that birth control stops my periods, as i have sensory problems and really struggle with them, however i dont think it is worth it for me personally if i feel fully asexual."
18154,Is there a method of birth control that wont affect my libido?
18155,"If i stop taking the pill, how long will it take for me to go back to normal?"
18156,I feel this issue is really putting a strain on my relationship and my wellbeing.
18157,It took me over a year after getting off a hormonal iud to get my libido back.
18158,The iud totally numbed me emotionally and zapped my libidothe emotions started to come back relatively quickly (23 months) but the libido took much longer for me.
18159,Use condoms
18160,This is why Ill never take birth control.

18165,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
18166,I honestly thought my bc killed my libido.
18167,Turns out I had an infection that some how went unnoticed because of a constant period I started bc at a bad part in my cycle and got stuck in the constant bleeding stage for a year!
18168,I'm back on bc after a 4 month break now and so far it's gone well?
18169,"I'd recommend trying the implant, the one in your arm."
18170,"It didn't affect me at all last time I was on it, barely noticed it at all.Personally last time I got it removed, my nurse didn't wait for me to be fully numb and I can't speak up for myself so now I'm too freaked out to get another one!"
18171,"But that was mostly my fault, anaesthetic takes longer to work on me than others, and I should have spoken up."
18172,"They are very over worked at the clinic so can't blame her much, she is a very lovely lady who helped me a lot with other issues."
18173,Maybe try out another pill/another method?
18174,"Hormones can affect libido, but it is trial and error."
18175,"Never had a lack of libido myself on the combo pill and the arm Implant, but it is so personal!And how are you doing mentally?"
18176,How is your life going?
18177,"Things like depression, stress and a burnout can also kill your libido"
18178,What about copper spiral ?
18179,No hormones in that.
18180,But you might bleed more tho.
18181,This spiral is best for people who usually don't bleed extremely much.
18182,a year??
18183,i have only been on the pill for about 6 months i really hope it wont tale that long.
18184,"I will be using condoms but i hate getting my period, any way to prevent that?"
18185,do you have a solution for me?
18186,This is a worst case scenario to be honest.
18187,There are so many horror stories about the pill on reddit.
18188,"For most people, the side effects are not that severe and its very unlikely to cause long lasting damage."
18189,A lot of people also forget that hormones change with time and some people are on BC for years.
18190,I would suspect it would come back pretty quick for you if you have only been on it for 6 months (assuming that it is the BC causing it).
18191,"Everyone also reacts entirely different to all forms of BC and you wont know until you try so if your symptoms dont disappear, you can always try another one."
18192,"Natural isnt always better, especially if you have a hormone imbalance so dont listen to all the scary stories you hear."
18193,"No, but maybe you can change your relationship to your period."
18194,Start to notice the gifts it brings.
18195,"I feel much more creative and tender during my period, I get to take really good care of myself then too."
18196,You can ask your boyfriend to be extra loving to you and caretake you during that week.
18197,All I can say is id try going off it and see if it returns

18211,The only way for you to be pregnant is if your ovulation date were wrong.
18212,Sept 8 i had sex and I took pt yesterday
18213,Its way too early to test.
18214,You wouldnt even be pregnant yet.
18215,"Nobody here can tell you if youll get pregnant, as youve been told many times."

18218,I am having the worst cramping I have ever experienced.
18219,Its almost paralyzing.
18220,Every time I walk it hurts every time I lay the wrong way it hurts.
18221,is there a fix to this pain or any advice that could be given.
18222,"I have a heating pad, I have taken ibuprofen, I have also taken Tylenol."
18223,Nothing is helping.
18224,A big concern of mine is how long is going to be until my spouse and I have to wait until inner course again I am reading horror stories of people that had to wait months.
18225,any knowledge or advice would be amazing.
18226,If you're experiencing paralyzing cramping with no relief you may want to consider going to your closest ER.
18227,"I'm not sure how long ago you had your Skyla inserted,  but it may have moved in your uterus and could be causing your cramping."

18234,"yes, i went to the doctor yesterday and everything looked good for them."
18235,hey yall!
18236,i (F21) got on birth control at the end of june for the first time in my life.
18237,"my gyno started me on lo loestrin fe june 25th the first sunday after my period and i have never missed a pill, take it every night to the exact minute, give or take maybe 510min a handful of times.my first month, i got a heavy period on the third week with clots and did not bleed on my placebo."
18238,last month and this month i have had sporadic spotting.
18239,"second month it lasted about two weeks, stopped, and then i bled on my placebos."
18240,this month i started breakthrough bleeding 5 days ago (3rd week) and continue to.
18241,"i start my placebos on wednesday.being that this is my 3rd pack, and i am still experiencing this, when does it become a concern?"
18242,i am starting to think i may need a higher dose which sucks because i practically have no side effects besides this.

18248,"Hi,  I'm an OB/Gyn nurse and I think I can help answer your question."
18249,The provider I work with tells patients it can take up to 3 months for your body to adjust to a new birth control.
18250,"Therefore you can have break through bleeding for the first three months, but if it continues then it might be time to discuss a different OCP that might work better for you."
18251,You might consider scheduling an appointment with your doctor to discuss this.
18252,Hope this helps!
18253,"Figured I would reach out, Im on Lo Loestrin Fe and have had some weird side effects, could I message you?"
18254,Sure that's fine.
18255,I'll help the best I can
18256,I messaged you!
18257,I spoke to an OB about my new birth control (Twirla patch)  told her my concern with a clot that I passed since my body has never done this before  she told me that it was normal so nothing to worry about.
18258,"However, she said to take a pregnancy test because all birth controls take 30 days for them to work but I told her I read that it only takes 7 days from first use and she swore that it was 30 days  that I should take a test."
18259,That freaked me out because the last thing I wanna be is pregnant  we used a condom  I even checked it for any leakage.
18260,Has anyone else ever heard of this or has been told this?
18261,?
18262,It is 7 days as outlined in the pamphlet that comes with your patches.
18263,No birth control that I know of takes 30 days.
18264,My OBGYN told me to wait a month after Nexplanon insertion but I knew thats not true so if I had to guess they say that erring on the side of caution.
18265,7 days after first use before its fully effective and can be considered a birth control method is what i was told on the combo pill and when i got my implant.
18266,menstrual bleeding will usually change while on birth control but should regulate after a few months or sooner.

18302,He agrees that the situation was weird and having siblings and family in the room was very strange.

18304,You need to report this doctor and see another one.
18305,She is breaking so many ethical regulations.

18307,"They have a delivery service, as do other companies."
18308,If you search the sub youll find some reviews for these services and you should be able to get your prescription without too much trouble.
18309,"Report, report, report, and find a new provider ASAP!"
18310,Please leave back to Canada at 18.
18311,The USA is a shithole and Texas especially.
18312,It does not cause cancer.

18314,"Definitely find another doctor or order online Nurx, Lemonaid app, wisp, pandia health."
18315,I would also report that doctor/make a complaint.
18316,Shes clearly pushing her personal beliefs on you.
18317,Texas either has or is trying to make it illegal to take public roads out of the state to get an abortion.
18318,"No offense, but fuck Texas."
18319,I have family that live there and I will never move back because of their healthcare and treatment of women.
18320,"Also, birth control does NOT cause cancer."
18321,I know some bcs can help reduce your risk of cancer.
18322,(link) (Edit.
18323,The link I provided goes directly to the government cancer website.
18324,You absolutely need to report this doctor.
18325,Everything she said to you is false.
18326,Shes out of her fucking mind.
18327,Also Im not entirely sure about Texas but at 16 you are old enough in most states to make your own medical decisions and forcing you to have your family in the room is a violation of HIPAA
18328,"Im so sorry this happened to you( If youre ok with it, I have some screenshots from I think r/birthcontrol with a list of obgyns in different cities in Texas that people have had good experiences with as far as getting birth control/approval for procedures etc."
18329,I found my doctor on there and shes been great so far.
18330,I could message it to you!
18331,Id link the post but its from a p long time ago and I cant find it
18332,Call the Texas Medical Board to report the doctor because holy hell she's breaking ethics.
18333,"Girl, Im a certified pharmacy technician in the US."
18334,"I can tell you what to ask for instead.The pill you are on, Marvelon, is a combination of two hormones 0.15 mg desogestrel and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol.In the United States that exact combination AND strength/dosage is present in Desogen, Apri, and Enskyce."
18335,"There may be a few others but those are the most common ones.There are some really similar common ones like Mircette, Velivet, and Kariva that have just a touch less estrogen, but are still the same hormones.This page has a list of all the pills that have the same hormones, but might have slightly different dosages.Feel free to DM me with questions."
18336,"this is horrible, im so sorry this is happening to you !"
18337,i reside in california and there is a womens clinic called fpa womens health you can call for telehealth services and i believe they can mail you your birth control.
18338,or possibly direct you to those app services that can also mail you your pills.
18339,"i tried to see if there are any in texas but all clinics are in california, but on there website it says they provide servics for people out of state.i have been to two clinics and they would bombard me with so many questions to change my mind about birth control, and when i found the fpa clinic they listened to my concerns and prescribed me what i wanted and informed me of risks so i can be aware in case i felt the pill isnt going great with my body."
18340,Report her and switch doctors.
18341,Like now.
18342,This doctor want to get you pregnant.
18343,Also she dose not know some birth control have better stuff like what you got to clear up acne and such.
18344,I would leave this doctor and report her to the board .
18345, Canadian who will have to move to the States for a LDR here.
18346,"First of all, I would try to order a full panel blood test to see if there is an underlying issue."
18347,Canadian doctors try to delay treatment for as long as possible and never do a deep dive unless you have an issue in front of them.
18348,"If you have PCOS or endometriosis, I would much rather learn about it now because you can do something about it that involves birth control or not."
18349,"If you have hormonal acne, you can treat it in ways that dont involve birth control."
18350,"Second, because you are in Texas, I strongly encourage you to switch to a hormonal IUD."
18351,"The failure rate is much lower than a pill, and it is much less dependent on human habits."
18352,"Third, I would report your doctor to their state board for numerous HIPPA violations as well as medical misinformation."
18353,"Fourth, go to a planned parenthood."
18354,They will give you more reliable information on birth control.
18355,Are you able to find a place that will insert an implant or iud?
18356,(If you're comfortable with that) depending on which kind it is they can last from 310 years.
18357,I just got the Nexplanon/Implanon implant in my arm and it's a huge weight off chest knowing it's very effective long term.
18358,Nurx can send you a prescription for a year to your pharmacy of choice.
18359,"They work with some insurances, and have lowcost options as well!"
18360,They got me my script THAT day when I was waiting around for my PP office to send one for 4 days.
18361,What.
18362,The.
18363,Actual.
18364,Fuck.
18365,"Yeah, no."
18366,None of what you described is normal.
18367,"Everyones already said good advice about reporting her, but theres also apps like Nurx that are telehealth and can get you birth control through your insurance without seeing a doctor"
18368,is this an actual doctor or one of those fake doctor offices ran by christians?
18369,Kudos to dad for supporting his childId report the doctor cause thats not what a doctor is supposed to do.
18370,Instill fear in their patients on what they chose to do with their bodys.
18371,"I know your situation is solved, but just wanna say that Im SO happy your dad is giving you the best support."
18372,"That doctor sounds insane, she shouldnt be practicing medicine."
18373,I hope things go better with the private practice!
18374,!
18375,Y'all need to get the hell out of Texas.
18376,I'm a native and I left.
18377,"Report her, fully and completely, and get a new doc."
18378,"Worst case, you can get BC online for 15/month."
18379,"Try Nurx, or Planned Parenthood."
18380,"Your body, your choice honey"
18381,That doctor is horrible.
18382,Im American so Im not familiar with laws and regulations but I even recall a dermatologist prescribing a pill to me for acne (I think an antibiotic?)
18383,when I was 13 or 14.
18384,I wasnt allowed on birth control as a minor and it would have helped me so much because I had severe PMDD so skipping my period would have prevented so many issues.
18385,"I also had an irregular period so Id leak all the time on my school uniform, which was khaki of course."
18386,I think you need to talk about getting a new doctor and asking if you can discuss personal topics privately.
18387,this might help?
18388,I just read up on the current Texas law for minors and sexual health.
18389,It is barbaric and heartbreaking.
18390,Find a new doctor ASAP!!
18391,"I live in the US as well and all I told my doctor was I wanted to be on birth control, and she didnt 2nd guess it."
18392,Ive been using bc since I was 14 and asked to be switched to depo a couple months ago.
18393,No questions asked by my doctor.
18394,"I understand if the doctor wants to explain the potential side effects, but they cant flat out tell you no, no matter your age (unless you have other underlying diseases)."
18395,Your doctor seems to be biased in her reasonings.
18396,Probably just a bad doctor.
18397,"I've lived in Texas my whole life, and all they've ever tried to do was put me on birth control."
18398,My SIL just got a hysterectomy.
18399,My little sister just got her tubes tied.
18400,Find another doctor.
18401,"Doctors and nurses are so hit and miss with birth control, it's a crime."
18402,I had a nurse practitioner refuse to insert a copper IUD because I never had children and it wouldn't insert.
18403,Even though my actual doctor and I discussed it to be best option.
18404,She absolutely pushed for hormonal IUD even though I said I could not have it.
18405,It was straight up bullying.
18406,"I repeatedly said ""I want to discuss this with my PCP"" and she was mad I wouldn't just do it."
18407,I never understood if it was a kickback or some weird control thing.
18408,Sounds like she needs to lose her license if this is how shes gonna practice.
18409,"This is not commonplace here in America, forcing you to have people in the room with you, youre entire family is a violation of HIPPA."
18410,This doctor should be reported immediately to the healthcare network they are apart of and the state medical board.
18411,Have you done the GoodRX gold membership free 30 day trial?
18412,"with that, you can get an online contraceptive consultation for 19.99."
18413,"Answer some questions, request your particular brand, and then ask to have it submitted to a local pharmacy for pick up."
18414,Welcome to Texas.
18415,I dont understand what Texas is trying to do.
18416,They have some of (if not the) highest rates of teen pregnancy and its shown that its attributed to the ass backwards logic of abstinence only sex education and lack of access to birth control and reproductive healthcare.
18417,The argument that teens on birth control will view as a green light to have sex is so stupid.
18418,Teenagers who wish to be sexually active will do so regardless and there are so many great reasons to be on birth control aside from reducing your risk of pregnancy.
18419,Get a different doctor.
18420,"Look into Nurx online in the meantime, you will most likely need parental consent but you can get your birth control prescribed and sent to your house.Want to also suggest that a loophole for this might be having a friend in Texas who is 18 go through the process and just give you the birth control until youre able to secure your own source"
18421,"If you absolutely cant get it with a normal doctor, Id recommend trying to get it from something like nurx, if you can afford it."
18422,"its all done through telehealth, and if you have insurance it should cover it."
18423,its how I got birth control for a while
18424,Why TF does she think you'll get cancer?
18425,What a stupid doctor to threaten you like that.
18426,Get another Dr !!!
18427,Asap  that is so unprofessional and also not true
18428,FIND A NEW DOCTOR... holy crap.... it's usually the OPPOSITE
18429,"Wow, that's unbelievable."
18430,I originally got on birth control for my skin.
18431,"Sounds like you got a terrible doctor and an unethical one, at that."
18432,I'm sorry you experienced that.
18433,She had no business communicating with you in that fashion.
18434,"If I were your parents, I'd be furious."
18435,Ive lived in the USA my whole life.
18436,"Im in the south, but were a swing state."
18437,I have never in my life had my entire family with me in the room.
18438,"Even when I was younger, they would always ask if I wanted privacy."
18439,What a strange thing.
18440,This is not common practice.
18441,Your doctor violated many HIPAA laws.
18442,Everyone has a right to their medical privacy.
18443,There are fines and jail time to breaking these laws.
18444,You should report her.
18445,Planned parenthood has Telehealth too.
18446,You can video chat with a provider.
18447,"At least, the last time I checked there was."
18448,Some people should not be doctors i swear to fucking god.
18449,"She violated a bunch of HIPAA laws, and she doesnt even know how birth control works."
18450,"If you're still in high school, you can get free birth control pills from your school nurse and they won't inform you parents."
18451,"If possible, you can also check out websites like 'Nurx', 'Hers', or even Lemonaid Health."
18452,They provide birth control for free with insurance or about 15 (if I'm not mistaken)
18453,Go to nurx.com!!
18454,You can get any kind of birth control there with NO prescription required.
18455,"Im not sure how it works with people under 18, but definitely check them out!"
18456,"Ive been getting my BC from them for years, they are absolutely fabulous!"
18457,Birth control usually PROTECTS you from cancer.
18458,And your doctor typically should prescribe birth control as long as youre physically healthy and you understand the risks.
18459,This doctor needs to have her license reviewed by the board.
18460,"Texas is shit, move back to Canada."
18461,Im 100 certain birth control caused me to have secondary infertility.
18462,I will never take it again.But Im sorry your doctor seems very unprofessional
18463,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.
18464,Questions?
18465,"First read the Mistake or Pregnancy Risk sticky( or the Consolidated Experience post( If this is an experience post please consider adding it to the listPlanned Parenthood online chat(The rules and additional resources can be found on the About / Sidepage (desktop users look to the right and Reddit app up top).I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
18466,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
18467,"Oh wow, the doctor was in the wrong 100."
18468,I know you are young but could you look into ordering the prescription online?
18469,I always order mine from the pharmacy and collect.
18470,It is all done online so you do not have to talk to anyone in person.
18471,That doctor is BS.
18472,Get a second opinion.
18473,Is it a combo BC ?
18474,The only dangers I could see are if you're epileptic or migraine prone.
18475,Estrogen is contraindicated for me because of these reasons and is potentially life threatening.
18476,I can't understand any other possible reasons
18477,Thank you.
18478,"I know there's a lot of planned parenthoods around, I'm very scared and many things here need parental consent or similar."
18479,I will research.
18480,yeah PLEASE report this doctor.
18481,that is so incredibly unethical and illegal
18482,YES!
18483,"Planned Parenthood is a god send for AFAB people whove had to deal with shit doctors who dont want us having our BC, especially for us in the south!"
18484,They saved my ass one time when my previous BC provider wouldnt give me an extra refill to last until my next appointment!
18485,unfortunately i dont think doctors in texas can be penalized for this anymore
18486,How do I go about reporting?
18487,I don't know Texas care and I'm very scaredOkay.
18488,I see I can report to Texas medical board.
18489,This!
18490,You've drastically decreased your quality of life moving from Canada to Texas.
18491,I'm not sure what your circumstances are but I would find a way to go back to Canada.
18492,Life is what you make of it.
18493,Glad you're doing the most to make your life the best it could be!
18494,/s
18495,I knew Texas was rough but not this rough.
18496,"I'm very upset, and wish all Doctors were like Canadian doctors."
18497,"my old doctor would explain the pros of bc, not push me against it."
18498,Yes!
18499,I switched from a traditional bc provider to an online provider after the former wouldnt give me a single refill until I saw them in person (even though I wouldve run out before said appointment) and Ive never been happier.
18500,Planned Parenthood is also a great source for bc and information on reproductive health.
18501,Agreed unfortunately a lot of people believe the cancer thing (most of my family did and told me Id regret going on even the mini pill (medical reasons) and while thankfully my dr is amazing my family is still apprehensive about me taking it (Im 25 though and dont need their consent thankfully)
18502,No offense taken.
18503,I love my home state but things are getting worse and worse.
18504,"i Also have to go through a specialist to get my Prozac, which I NEED to live."
18505,I'm worried I'm going to run out before I can even see a specialist
18506,This is exactly me with Indiana.
18507,I'm currently pregnant (planned) in a Blue state thankfully.
18508,I won't even travel there right because their archaic laws.
18509,Also would never raise a kid there because of their laws concerning LGBT and minorities.
18510,Yes please!
18511,"i am in the Austin area, I'd rather go to a Obgyn then this crappy gp."
18512,Omg.
18513,Thank you so much.
18514,This is extremely extremely helpful.
18515,"The other commenter told me to look for the similar doses, but I didn't know how to go about that."
18516,"Thank you so, so much."
18517,"This is very useful to tell my next, hopefully better, doctor."
18518,Thank you so much.
18519,That's an awesome resource.
18520,I'm going to make a couple phone calls today and see what I can figure out.
18521,"It felt awful having her push me so hard to get off of it, when I know I'm okay."
18522,"I'm disappointed that this is the norm in Texas, even though it was to be expected."
18523,Canadian doctors try to delay treatment for as long as possible and never do a deep dive unless you have an issue in front of them.That's kind of a broad brush.
18524,I've been worked up the yingyang just cause I said I was tired.
18525,It varies a lot depending on your doctor.
18526,"Also I agree with IUDs being a better option in the current red state political climate, but based on what the doctor was saying, this sounds like a ""you can only have an IUD after you have kids"" type doctor."
18527,"Plus, OP said they started hormonal BC for acne and the IUD may not give her the same results."
18528,"Actually, the implant might be good because the progestin shes taking now (desogestrel) is a prodrug for the one in the implant (etonogestrel), meaning her liver is presumably turning the desogestrel into etonogestrel anyway."
18529,"I have just tried nurx, it said due to laws in my state, I'm too young and they request a photo ID."
18530,I assume I have to be 18 then?
18531,"I'm in Austin, a native Austinite."
18532,"I figured out of everywhere in Texas, they'd be the safest/most progressive."
18533,This could just be a bad one off though.
18534,That's a good word.
18535,"It 100 felt like bullying, and it was such a culture shock because in Canada, i tell them what I want, and they support me."
18536,"I've never had to ""fight"" a doctor before."
18537,I have not heard of this!
18538,"My doctor said my brand did not exist in the US, which is Marvelon/Mirvala 28. i will check this out."
18539,It's embarrassing that people immediately assume birth control  sex.
18540,"I can see the reactions from ppl when they find out I'm on birth control, and assume I'm having tons of sex."
18541,"That never was the reason, and still isn't."
18542,"Even if I was, it's none of their fucking business."
18543,Plan parenthood also has an app for getting birth control aswell.
18544,PCOS is not caused by taking birth control.
18545,"No, you dont."
18546,BC does not cause PCOS.
18547,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge."
18548,It is a combo pill yes.
18549,"It's low dose, i am not epileptic or migraine prone."
18550,I am for the majority a perfectly healthy 16 year old.
18551,You could always call the clinic and ask them!
18552,Considering your location I would trust the staff of a legitimate Planned Parenthood (not a pregnancy crisis centre) over a lot of other providers.
18553,If your parents are safe people you could also talk to them about why you want birth control.
18554,"It would also help to tell them that while birth control could marginally increase the risk of some cancers, it decreases your lifetime risk of other cancers, including endometrial and cervical."
18555,Do you parents not know you take birth control?
18556,Werent that with you at the doctors appointment you describe where you asked the doctor for it?
18557,"I think you should talk to your parents about it, even if they are averse to the idea of you having sex youre using it for your skin primarily and you can explain that to them."
18558,"Im so sorry you had to deal with this ignorant, inconsiderate, and straight up deceptive doctor."
18559,I second the other comments here that you should report her and never go back.
18560,"Planned parenthood can likely get you the birth control prescription, but you may also want to still have a primary care doctor for other care, and this woman is clearly not going to be an option for that."
18561,"Read online reviews, Google doctors to see if you can gather any info on their background and beliefs (ie, Republican Party campaign donations  dont go to that doctor), and maybe ask around your friends in the area for recommendations for respectful, helpful, doctors who actually listen to women."
18562,"I dont know about confidentiality laws in the US, but in Canada, at 16, you definitely have the right to privacy concerning your medical file."
18563,"A doctor cannot inform your parents of anything healthwise without your consent, let alone force you to bring the whole family to the appointment."
18564,Hopefully there are some protections of that sort in Texas.
18565,I would recommend watching Mama Doctor Jones videos on birth control until you can find a genuine practitioner.
18566,"She is an OBGYN from Texas and used to practice here (is still currently licensed to I think), so she may have specific information youre looking for."
18567,Plan parenthood or a local health right clinic is the place to go!
18568,!
18569,"Im Canadian so Im not certain, but last I read Texas doctors still have to prescribe birth control to minors if the parent consents."
18570,I would report this from a privacy perspective and refusal of care without just cause.
18571,Having a guardian in the room is one thing but her entire family being there is another.
18572,I hope OP sees some justice for this.
18573,Im glad her family is taking her to another provider.
18574,Yeah theres a lot of push back right now since they overturned Roe v Wade.
18575,So some states you can get abortions and some you cant now.
18576,Im 33 and this is the first time in my lifetime Ive seen this unfortunately.
18577,Especially since youre young theyll be more supportive of you getting pregnant than preventing it.
18578,I dont want kids and never have wanted them.
18579,Trying to get sterilized is still hard at my age.
18580,Im fearing going to the doctor when I have to switch out my iud just from judgement of not having kids at my age.
18581,"100 if you dont want to do Planned Parenthood find an online doctor that prescribes birth control, they are super easy!"
18582,"You can get a month from one of the clinics at CVS, Walgreens, etc."
18583,Bring your bottle to prove you take it and tell them you are between docs and are afraid you will run out.
18584,Most practitioners will usually give you a month of a maintenance med as long as its not controlled.Do not stop taking an antidepressant abruptly.
18585,"Prozac has a pretty long halflife so its not as bad as some others, but its still bad, potentially."
18586,For my mental health I always go to an Internal Medicine doctor.
18587,Theyve been great.
18588,They are way more understanding.
18589,Go to a Gynecologist for your birth control.
18590,Look into HIPPA laws.
18591,"I can not stand horrible doctors and Im in the Lone Star state, too."
18592,I went to Planned Parenthood alone at 17.
18593,Had zero problems.
18594,Anytime you want to know about what you are taking you can check the medication inset.
18595,We wind up throwing them away in the pharmacy but you can get them online.
18596,Just google drug name medication insert.
18597,"You can use the inserts to double check equivalence and show them to your doctor.For Marvelon For Apri For Desogen For Enskyce Btw, 150 mcg (micrograms) is the same as 0.15 mg (milligrams) and 30 mcg is the same as 0.03 mg."
18598,"You are very welcome, hun, and dont hesitate to ask questions."
18599,"I knew this would be an issue, lol."
18600,Hormonal birth control can be extremely fucking confusing.
18601,There is literally a hundred fucking kinds and both the brand and the generics have idiotic fucking made up sassy girlfriend names.
18602,"Fortunately, the basic composition of the combined pill is the same an estrogen and a progestin."
18603,"The estrogen is almost always ethinyl estradiol, so the big difference (and what determines how well you tolerate it) is usually the progestin used."
18604,"The progestin in yours is desogestrel.Im only a technician, so make sure you double check with your doctor or pharmacist."
18605,deleted
18606,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge."
18607,"You might have to go with one that is the US version of the brand in that case, but it should still be something to try."
18608,This is how I got my Slynd refilled after Simple Health went out of business right before it came time to renew my script.
18609,"Only took a couple of hours of back and forth to get my script renewed, (it was 1 am), and then it was just waiting for my pharmacy to fill it."
18610,(don't forget to cancle the free trial before the 30 days is up if you don't want to keep it)
18611,"Look up the active ingredients and the amounts, then Google that and youll probably find the equivalent in the US"
18612,"Also when youre ready to have sex, youll already have protection on your end but of course still use condoms."
18613,But double protection is how you end up not as a teen pregnancy statistic!
18614,Yeah.
18615,Like birth control is a treatment for pcos.
18616,Not a cause
18617,They do know.
18618,"They encouraged me and told me it would be fine to get off, but I tried so hard to put my foot down and say no."
18619,"My step mom told me horror stories of people who stayed on birth control, but I know people that have been on their whole life and nothing bad happened."
18620,I feel very helpless.
18621,"I had to reveal that I got an std panel done in front of them, so i assume they know I've had sex."
18622,They put me and my brother in the same exam room and asked inappropriate questions about private areas in front of each other.
18623,"I am not at all squeamish at the doctor, but this was heavily embarrassing."
18624,Thank you for the support.
18625,"This was a humiliating, embarrassing trip to the doctor.I brought this up to my friends and they say it took much trial and error to find doctors that are genuinely respectful."
18626,"They say that male doctors are more open then female doctors, but I feel at such a loss right now."
18627,The treatment Texas is giving to women is heartbreaking.
18628,The childfree subreddit has a list of doctors by state who perform sterilizations!
18629,"I mean i know that you mean well and i dont wanna come across as disrespectful, but it's not your business op's choice towards the pill."
18630,"In my country, birth control pills are a choice for many many many many things and one of them is acne, and let me tell you that some types of acne are pretty dangerous."
18631,"Its also a choice for dangerously anemic states, people with special conditions, certain treatments... you don't know op's diagnose."
18632,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge."
18633,Thank you!
18634,"I want to go to Dr. Genoveva Prisacaru, recommended by another commenter, and I'll research internal medicine doctors."
18635,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge."
18636,There is not enough evidence to say that staying on birth control your entire life is significantly harmful.
18637,"There was one Danish study that did NOT hold up under further investigation(The breast cancer effects described now in multiple studies wane with time, and in the long term, hormonal contraception use has been found not to be associated with any increased total cancer risk.There is also some evidence that longterm birth control users are at an increased risk of prediabetes, however they are not at any increased risk for diabetes type II (Nor type I)."
18638,"Prediabetes can be managed with incredibly minimal diet changes.Listen, Im a nurse."
18639,I dont understand how these fuckwits managed to get into medicine.
18640,What you went through is appalling.
18641,Weirdly I have only ever felt judged or dismissed by female doctors.
18642,"All my male OBGYNs have been amazing, even in the Deep South.Birth control has side effects like everything else."
18643,"Some women dont like hormones, but most are fine."
18644,"If you find something that works, then thats good.There may be an over the counter BC coming soon."
18645,"I see, well I really hope you can find someone who can meet your needs."
18646,I would definitely add the part about you and your siblings all having the exams done together to your report against this doctor.
18647,"I dont know exactly what the laws or regulations are, but it is highly inappropriate for a multitude of reasons to have teenagers share appointments like that, with each other and with the parents."
18648,"It also standard procedure for the doctor to insist on time alone with a patient, especially a teen, in case there is any abuse going on that they need to know about but obviously cannot be shared in front of the parents who may be the abusers."
18649,So your doctor has absolutely failed in her duty to ensure the safety of her patients who are minors and should thus be reported for that.
18650,"Your post was removed due to lack of respect towards other users (personal attacks, name calling, trolling, etc.)"
18651,Arent hormonal (combo) birth control pills also shown to be protective against cancers in the uterus and reproductive organs too?
18652,Meaning they reduce your likely hood of getting them.
18653,PCOS runs in my family.
18654,Birth control is giving me other benefits as well.
18655,I don't want to be a teen pregnancy statistic either.
18656,"I'm on low dose, it's not as horrible as others."
18657,You don't need to insult me for my body choices.
18658,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge."
18659,I didnt see any studies in PubMed.
18660,"However, I was not looking very hard."
18661,I searched Long Term hormonal contraceptive use and picked the first couple of studies that said something negative in the title because that was what I was looking for
18662,"I have a Kyleena iud, its a low hormone thingy i think, I dont know if its like, the kind that can effect ur own hormones."
18663,"Basically I have bpd, im on mood meds and shit, the pill immediately messed my mood up, a common side effect of the pill."
18664,But does Kyleena do that too?
18665,Ive tried researching it but I cant find anything that mentions it.
18666,I think im definitely susceptible to things messing with my mood because I have a mood disorder.
18667,"But does anyone know anything about it, is it possible?Also, its just been a crazy 2 years since graduating, couch hopping and moving in with my partner."
18668,"Had an abortion in March and it really fed me up, Im just really sick of my emotional unstability, Im getting help in shit but I just wanna know if my iud could be a contributing factor"
18669,"All birth control (pills, iuds (hormonal or not), patches, shots) can effect your mood."
18670,Low hormone isnt even significantly lower than regular hormone  its just a way to market or refresh a patent.
18671,It can all effect your mood and libido

18676,"thank you so much, im going to talk to my gyno, i appreciate it"
18677,My wife had her first paragard inserted 6 years ago  we're not sure but we believe in the past year she's had a couple of miscarriages.
18678,Her period was very spotty/heavier than normal  she believes some of it looked like tissue.
18679,The most recent one lasted nearly 5 weeks which sparked us to head to an OBGYN.
18680,"After doing bloodwork  finding no issues, they performed an ultrasound  found that her paragard was sitting ""too low"" in her uterus."
18681,She's 5 feet tall  does have a small frame.
18682,"Since it was nearing the end of its usage, they removed it  inserted a fresh one, then performed another ultrasound several weeks later only to come back with the same result of ""sitting too low""."
18683,These were placed in by two different nurse practitioners.
18684,OBGYN concluded that her uterus is too small for paragard which is why it won't sit correctly.
18685,"They say since it was too low, it left a small ""window"" open at the top which may have caused the miscarriages IF that's what happened."
18686,We have an active sex life  never had a pregnancy scare for those 6 years.
18687,They've told her the only options now are to use hormonalbased IUDs which she cannot do due to health reasons plus I don't want her to have to deal with the problems associated with hormonebased birth control.
18688,"Pills are 100 out of the question too.In response to this, we scheduled my vasectomy  I had that done almost 2 weeks ago so I am still recovering then will have to get tested around week 9 to ensure I'm sterile."
18689,"However, I've read about lots of cases where recanalization happens  the vasectomy fails which has me a little worried that maybe we need to revisit the copper IUD again so we can have double protection as we absolutely do not want children, do not want to go through an abortion  do not want to get her tubes tied."
18690,I'm planning on testing my vasectomy every 23 months even though I'm being told that's excessive (everyone seems to recommend annual testing).Has anyone ever heard of this issue where the uterus is too small for paragard?
18691,Should we get a second opinion?
18692,Yeah.
18693,"I had the exact same issue with mine (both being set too low, having a small frame, and having tissue come out with my period at times) and I had to just get it out for good."
18694,Unfortunately some womens bodies justdont like having metal shoved up there and spit it back out.
18695,"I wish you both the best, I understand how much it sucks to have so few options."
18696,In my case my partner and I want kids so sterilization is out of the picture for us.
18697,(
18698,"Paraguard is larger than the inside of the average womans uterus, thats why its rarely used in other countries."
18699,Its not recommended women whove never been pregnant at all.
18700,The US is just really slow to approve new IUDs.
18701,There are tons of smaller copper IUDs in Canada and the EU.
18702,If you can manage a trip to Canada she could get one inserted there.

18708,Its not recommended women whove never been pregnant at all.ohhh that makes sense.
18709,It's amazing that was never explained to us at either OBGYN office.
18710,It seems stupid to me that there's only ONE option for copper IUDs in the US.
18711,I guess its crazy we never had a pregnancy scare for 6 years with an improperly set IUD.
18712,mostly just vaginal discharge.
18713,i hope your second one goes better.
18714,This is not true.
18715,It is NOT contraindicated in those who have not been pregnant or who havent had children.
18716,Everyones uterus is a different size and there are different risks/benefits for everyone with various methods.
18717,Her frame and height have nothing to do with the size of her uterine cavity.
18718,There are not many contraindications to progestinonly methods (like the hormonal IUD) although there definitely can be side effects.
18719,I think its definitely worth getting another opinion IF she wants another nonhormonal IUD.
18720,They can do the insertion under ultrasound guidance to ensure its placed where its supposed to be.
18721,"You could also use methods like spermicide, condoms, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap as a buddy to the vasectomy."
18722,But a vasectomy (and especially one thats been tested 3 months after) is very reliable.
18723,"I personally think a Paragard is overkill with a vasectomy, particularly because side effects are typically heavier/longer/crampier bleeding."
18724,I have struggled since age 11 with long heavy irregular periods.
18725,I recently decided to talk to my doctor about everything and they diagnosed me with pcos (i assumed for years this was the case with some quick google searches).
18726,I decided to finally get on birth control in hopes of having a regular normal period every month and was prescribed Hailey 24 fe.
18727,What are some of your experiences with this birth control or with other birth control pills and pcos?Sincerely a girl who hates taking medication even ibuprofen _

18734,Horrible idea.
18735,Im so moody and my body hurts so badly.
18736,I feel like I should just be on the pill if its both or one or the other but no one will take the implant out.

18759,YUP I had to use a similar phrase to get my dr to take mine out in 2017
18760,Hi all!
18761,New to posting here and also new to an IUD at all.
18762,"I'm 42, have a nearly 10 yr old kid, and had a broken condom happen earlier this summer which was horrifying (Plan B to the rescue) and really emphasized to me that I do NOT want more kids.My plan is a tubal cautery/ligation/whatever as soon as I can, with an appointment already booked for November.I got my Mona Lisa inserted last Tuesday morning as a stopgap, and I'm trying to figure out what's normal and what isn't."
18763,"Insertion was really simple, and the nursepractitioner said I was a breeze and had a really great uterus/cervix to work with."
18764,Just a couple of minor cramps during insertion and I went home without dizziness or anything.
18765,"Since then, I've had low level cramping (mostly while driving) similar to early period cramps."
18766,"For the two days after insertion I had clotting, achey cramps, and brown/pink blood but nothing major."
18767,"The NP told me NOT to feel around for my strings, and that it wasn't really necessary these days.I had sex with my partner on Saturday and felt NO pain in any position (yay!)"
18768,but I found out afterward that I had bled on the sheets (boo).
18769,"Sunday I had more cramps than before  similar to insertion day   and a bit more blood, which sucked but I figured the enthusiastic Saturday fun probably was the culprit.Today I am bleeding much more, like a medium period day."
18770,Blood is red.
18771,"Cramps are easing up a bit, which is nice.Is this normal?"
18772,And also when the heck does this whole cramping/bleeding stop?!
18773,I got this thing so I could have barrierfree sex with my beloved partner finally and ruining sheets every time we get down is really not something I'm keen on.Advice?

18779,Spotting or bleeding is common after a copper IUD insertion.
18780,"When I had one, I bled lightly for 2 weeks leading up to my period."
18781,After that it was smooth sailing.
18782,"Just like any BC method, there is a transition period where your body will need to adjust to the IUD."
18783,"For most people, the bleeding will subside in time."
18784,"For others, it doesn't and they get it removed."
18785,"You can either wait it out for a few weeks or a couple months, or have it removed and try a different method until you get sterilized."
18786,Good luck!
18787,Thanks for that!
18788,"I wouldn't call this light bleeding by end of work today  more like medium to heavy period level bleeding for me, but for a week, with cramps ranging from 'present' to 'OW'."
18789,"I really really want it to settle down soon, because I WANT this to work."
18790,"Hormones and I don't do super well together as a rule, so this looked ideal as the intermediate safety precaution until formal ligation, but again, if this means I'm looking at a number of months of nonstop bleeding and very owie cramps, I may be reconsidering!"
18791,Hi everyone!
18792,"So, I have ankylosing spondylitis and UCTD (leaning towards RA), I am at a point in my treatment now that my rheumatologist is requiring me to get an IUD or permanent BC to continue trying new medications.I was dead set on the paragard because I've been on hormonal birth control for most of my life now, and I was hoping that maybe my mental health would improve along with just wanting to minimize the amount of medications I'm putting in my body, but when I went to a consultation appointment with my new gyno she's really trying to push me towards the mirena, and now I'm honestly conflicted about it."
18793,Obviously there's plenty of horror stories of both out there.
18794,I've read a lot of experiences on here but I haven't really been able to find anyone who had an autoimmune condition talking about how their IUD has (or hasn't) affected their disease.
18795,I really would love if anyone has any experiences with the mirena or paragard because I believe those are my only options.

18818,I literally just had my Kyleena removed and it was soooo much better than insertion.
18819,Id had the Kyleena inserted under sedation but had moved and my new gyno didnt offer that.
18820,She prescribed me a Xanax to take an hour before the procedure so I wouldnt panic and it definitely helped.
18821,I was terrified because I hadnt been able to feel my strings lately and thought it might be a difficult removal but the lovely PA I saw was able to find them and it was like a tugging feeling and then a cramp.
18822,It felt like the cramps I used to get as a teenager but nowhere near as bad as my Skyla insertion at 23 (Im 30 now).
18823,"Insertion was a 9/10, removal Id give a 4/10."
18824,You're fortunate.
18825,"I had my first IUD inserted yesterday, and to my surprise, I fainted when my OB/GYN measured my uterus."
18826,"She suggested rescheduling for another day, but I was determined."
18827,"I told her that if she didn't proceed right away, I might never consider getting an IUD again."
18828,"It's worth noting that she didn't use clamps to hold my cervix, which could have made the pain even worse."
18829,"Despite having a high pain tolerance, I never expected it to be quite that intense."
18830,My Skyla insertion was awful like that.
18831,"If you decide to get another IUD, definitely try to look for a place that offers sedation."
18832,I think I saw a thread in this sub where people listed doctors that are known to offer it.
18833,"I'm currently in Switzerland, 19 years old, and I continue to visit Planned Parenthood because the OBGYNs there are consistently kind, even though they change every six months."
18834,"When I experienced a traumatic event, they provided support, testing, and helped me make a decision, which made me feel safe about getting the IUD."
18835,"Although nitrous oxide was offered, I declined it due to my fear of losing control and flinching."
18836,"The doctor's sweetness and commitment to obtaining my consent were crucial, and I doubt I would have gone through with the IUD procedure if it were another OBGYN, to be honest"
18837,But i didnt insist on getting any other pain relief bc i have high pain tolerance so its mostly my fault tbh
18838,I have had my Mirena IUD for around 5 months.
18839,"I have been spotting for almost the entire 5 months, besides a day or 2 every month Also my acne is now HORRIBLE, even though Im on spironolactone has anyone else had these experiences??"

18845,Hi!
18846,"I had a Mirena IUD for 7 years (it was good for 5, but my doc said the expiration date was extended from newer studies that came out) following the copper iud."
18847,I ended up getting very heavy and prolonged bleeding and cramping with my copper iud which prompted me to switch to the Mirena.
18848,"The Mirena immediately stopped the bleeding within a day, and I didnt have a period for 7 years which was awesome!"
18849,I took it out because I am wanted to see what I felt like off of any type of birth control.
18850,"I have been off of Mirena for a year now and I realized it was me very anxious and depressed, I had this dreadful hopeless empty feeling most days and suicidal ideation."
18851,I didnt realize it was due to the hormones until i was off of them for 68 months.
18852,I did love the clear skin and no periods.
18853,I doubt I will go back on the Mirena but I would consider the copper iud in the future even though my periods were heavier and longer.
18854,I hope this helps!
18855,Everyone reacts differently to different hormones.
18856,Consult with your doctor and tell them the symptoms you have on this progestin hormone birth control (Mirena) and see if they recommend a different type of chemical cocktail based off the symptoms the progestin presented in you.
18857,"Good luck, also remember when/if you get the Mirena out your acne may get worse before it gets better."
18858,I felt like a teenager 6 months after removal and the acne got better after 34 months after that.
18859,I am thinking about changing my IUD from my current Kyleena to Mirena or Liletta.
18860,My main motivating factor for the switch is that I dont need it replaced as soon.
18861,"I know that I will not want children in 5 years, but 7 could be a possibility."
18862,I am nervous about switching as I have had 0 problems with my current kyleena IUD.
18863,"I am most concerned about   Periods, I have not had a period in the 5 years that I have had my current IUD   Weight gain, I have read that the higher dosages could influence weight gain   Acne   Feeling the IUD inside me."
18864,I vaguely remember that the choice for the doctor to give me Kyleena was influenced by the size of my uterus and am nervous that I might feel a different IUD inside of me.
18865,Any advice or personal experience would be greatly appreciated!

18870,To make a long story short Ive been on some sort of hormonal BC since I was like 15 (Im now 32).
18871,I went from the pill to the Nexplanon and had a total of 3 replaced/put in.
18872,During the last Nexplanon I had HORRIBLE side effects.
18873,"Depression, constant bleeding, hair loss, no libido."
18874,December 2022 I got it out and went back on the pill.
18875,A lot of the side effects got better but Im still having mood swings and zero sex drive.
18876,My doc suggested using the Kyleena IUD but the idea terrifies me.
18877,I know you cant believe everything you read but Ive heard some horror stories as well as people having similar side effects to what I experienced with the Nexplanon.
18878,Plus theres just something about the IUD the skeeves me.
18879,So Im at the point of feeling like Im out of options.
18880,I want my sex drive back and the mood swings to go away.
18881,Has anyone else had a similar experience and found something that works?

18887,"Ive tried nexplanon, Nuvaring, and other hormonal pills and have had insane mood swings and anxiety too."
18888,Youre not alone.I just saw my OB last week and she also suggested the lower dosage of the Kyleena IUD.
18889,Im going to try it for a few months and see if I like it.
18890,I would listen to your doctor and trust them and try it out for a little.
18891,"Also, Kyleena is progestin not estrogen (which Im on now and I believe nexplanon is estrogen based too)."
18892,"Nah Nexplanon is progestin only still no estrogen, but not the same type of progestin as the hormonal IUDs."
18893,Hope Kyleena works well for you!
18894,Oh okay I didnt know that!
18895,Thank you for clarifying ) I hope Kyleena works for me too
18896,Ive been on the nuvaring for over a year.
18897,I have PCOS.

18917,So I got my new IUD about 2 and a half weeks ago.
18918,I havent had hormonal before so Im not sure what your experience with your period is supposed to be like.
18919,Ive been having period cramps for the past couple days and it is around the time my cycle would be I was just wondering if this is normal.
18920,"Im assuming it is, but I thought you didnt really get your period with this, or if you did it was just very light."
18921,Maybe this is just my version of a light period.

18926,I got the Mirena in about 2 years ago now.
18927,I originally chose to get off BC and go the IUD route because I was having awful periods with super abnormal bleeding.
18928,For the first year I had no problems at all and I loved it.
18929,"For the past year, ive been having random excruciating pain in my cervix on my left and right side."
18930,"Sometimes its random, but its always present during intercourse."
18931,I went to my OB and the only insight I got was that I have small cysts that keep forming and bursting but nothing theyre concerned about.
18932,"She recommended me getting on BC ontop of my IUD, which I tried for about 3 months."
18933,It helped so much with the sharp pain I was having but I couldnt tolerate the side effects.
18934,"I was dealing with depression, no libido(which is not normal for me at all), and irritability."
18935,"Now that im off the BC, I finally feel like myself again but the pain is back."
18936,I dont know if I should get my IUD out and go back on the BC and deal with the abnormal bleeding/pain or what other options I even have.
18937,"I feel like every OB ive gone to doesnt care to help me find a solution to this, so im just hoping to hear anyones experiences or advice."
18938,Thank you

18972,"After recently finding out I had an increased risk of VTEs due to family history and a weird onset of chest pains (tests came back all clear after a referral to AE, nothing serious, so no clots for me yay!!"
18973,"), my GP ended up recommending that I switch to the POP and prescribed a 75 microgram Desogestrel pill."
18974,"For the past 3.5 months I was on Marvelon (Ethinylestradiol/Desogestrel) and other than this last week of terrible anxiety over chest pain and some spotting when starting out, I really loved it, so Im a bit sad about switching (especially since I bought myself a 6 month supply, ( but oh well, better than worrying about an increased risk of clots).I was wondering if people (especially any who have made a similar switch from Marvelon or any COC to a POP) dont mind sharing their experiences on the mini pill."
18975,"My main concern at the moment is spotting or frequent bleeding, though Im wondering if my body will adjust fine because its the same progesterone hormone?"
18976,(not sure if thats how that works.
18977,Is it the estrogen in the pill that limits bleeding?)
18978,"Im currently on my pill free week and I intend to start it it as soon as I receive it anyways (so either in 24 or 48 hours) (wonder if that will affect bleeding at all /)I know everyones reactions to the pill are different, but it would be nice to hear about some more experiences!!"

19032,I went to the doctor today because my appetite ever since my pills have switched is just gone.
19033,I went from being 170 pounds to 155 in just a few weeks.
19034,The doctor said this is normal with birth control?
19035,Is that true or am I just getting shoved to the side?
19036,A FEW WEEKS??
19037,Have you been eating literally nothing?
19038,It is wild to lose that amount of weight in 21 days.
19039,"Were you retaining water before?Yes you are getting shoved to the side, especially if you lose more weight."
19040,"Hmm, Im not a doctor but Id say not normal  its never healthy to lose that much weight that rapidly even more so because your appetite has disappeared, definitely not normal"
19041,"I don't know if this is a side effect, not one I have heard of though."
19042,"But as someone with anxiety, I know it can do a number."
19043,"I stumbled across this and I just wanted to share this recently happened to me and it was completely unrelated to my birth control.If your GP or GYN won't help, consider seeing a gastro."
19044,I lost 20 pounds (135 to 115) in about 3 weeks.
19045,"I had severe stomach pain when I ate, so I just didn't."
19046,When I finally broke down and did I would nibble a bit and immediately have to get up and go to the restroom.
19047,"I finally went to a gastro, got blood work done."
19048,It flagged for chrons.
19049,A colonoscopy later and luckily no chrons but I do have severe IBSD.
19050,"So...they don't know what it is, just what it's not lol."
19051,Either way they gave me amitriptyline and as long as I take it I am good.
19052,I go every 6 months now and they have to keep an eye on me for increased colon cancer risk.

19088, i just started birth control and i was left confused abt some things (im on the pill btw).
19089,my main confusion that I didnt really get an answer from my OB was what were the brown pills for do I take them with the white pill when I start a new pack or do i take them once a day like i take the white pill?
19090,Is it OK for me to skip them?
19091,my OB kind of rushed the appointment and left me very confused and my friends can only tell me so much.
19092,I also wanted to know is it OK to have unprotected sex on the pill?
19093,Am I likely to get pregnant?
19094,Thats all advice would be appreciated ty )
19095,"you take one pill in the pack per day, going left to right and line by line."
19096,"most bc pill packs will have 3 weeks of active (hormone) pills and one week of inactive pills (sometimes they're brown because they only contain iron, not hormones)."
19097,you are still protected during the inactive week if you took the active pills as prescribed.
19098,how long it takes for the pills to become effective depends on where you were in your cycle when you started the first pill in the pack.
19099,"to be safe, use protection like a condom for the first week of taking the pill."
19100,"at this point you are considered protected if you took the pills exactly as prescribed, and whether or not you choose to continue using condoms is up to you."
19101,bc pills can't prevent sti's and there is always a small risk of pregnancy for every birth control method.
19102,there is an instruction/information document in every pill pack.
19103,"it's incredibly long and intimidating but I highly, highly recommend reading it through and bringing up questions to your doctor."

19109,"Having sex while you are on birth control is not ""unprotected""."
19110,Using your method corectly decreases your risk of pregnancy.
19111,Using your method incorrectly increases the risk.
19112,"Birth control does not prevent STIs, so if there is a possibility that something could be passed, barrier methods such as male or female condoms should be used for penetration.As for your dosing question, most pills will either be in a little rectangle that looks like a calendar page or a circle."
19113,You will take each pill in order around the same time daily.
19114,"Without knowing which brand you have, I can't say if the last pills contain active hormones or not."
19115,Without being prescribed to skip placebo pills will run you short and insurance may not cover a refill sooner.
19116,You are still protected against pregnancy during placebo pills given the rest of the pack was taken correctly.

19137,Its totally normal.
19138,The dosage in your implant decreases over time.
19139,The dosage is high enough to prevent pregnancy but might not be enough to suppress bleeding.
19140,If the bleeding persists or gets worse you have a couple options to discuss with your doctor.
19141,You could try the birth control pill for 13 months.
19142,This can regulate bleeding for some people.
19143,If the bleeding is prolonged you can do an ibuprofen trial.
19144,"Finally, you could just get the implant replaced early."
19145,"I'm on my 4th nexplanon, i just got my first spotting too, ive had it 17 months."

19158,Mine just wont stay on for the last few months
19159,Thank you so much !
19160,Im 26/F.
19161,Went on birth control pill when I was 18 for protection purposes.
19162,I always had pretty clear skin in my teen years.
19163,"Suddenly after 12 years of starting BC, my acne worsened."
19164,"And it stayed bad for the entire 7 years I was on BC, I tried everything but nothing helped it."
19165,I finally quit the pill Jan 2022 and my skin unfortunately stayed very bad.
19166,I went on accutane which was a miracle drug that cleared up my acne.
19167,Ive been off for 5 months now and my skin has stayed so clear.I want to go back on the pill for protection again but I am terrified of my acne coming back.
19168,Has anyone had a similar experience?
19169,What BC pills seemed to not trigger your acne??
19170,TIA.
19171,It doesnt sound like the birth control pill caused your acne if it didnt start until over a year in and didnt end when you stopped.
19172,How did you get the acutane while stopping the pill?
19173,Guidelines for acuntane are very strict about patients needing multiple forms of birth control to even get the prescription.
19174,"So whatever method you used then you could stick with, if you had none that was a huge oversight by your doctor and they should not be prescribing that medication."
19175,The main difference between birth control pills is mini pill (progestin only) vs combo pill (estrogen and progestin).
19176,"Generally speaking, combo has more of an acnefighting reputation than the mini pill."
19177,But it really just varies from person to person.
19178,"I believe there are some specific brands that are the first line recommendations from dermatologists, but none of them are guarantees."
19179,It is common to have to try out a few to find the best fit for you.
19180,"However since Ive noted that the evidence stands against the pill as the cause of your acne, Id recommend keeping up with your acne care team independently of your birth control choices."
19181,There are lotssss of of options besides acutane.
19182,If it didnt start till a year or two in it most likely wasnt your pill.
19183,BC side effects generally show up within the first 36 months.
19184,Combination pills are generally recommended to help with acne.
19185,The combined pill I usef to take made my skin look like a babys bum.
19186,"Never had prettier, clearer skin than back then"

19191,Yaz or any Yaz generic is good for acne.
19192,It will take 36 months to adjust.
19193,Im on NIKKI (Yaz generic).
19194,"Thank you for the advice!Im in Canada, and we dont require the iPledge system to go on accutane."
19195,I chose abstinence as Im not in a relationship right now.
19196,I completed monthly pregnancy tests as well.
19197,This was all okay with my derm. )
19198,Which one was it?
19199,"Hmm, I had tried Yaz for 4 months and if anything it made my acne worse ( definitely didnt improve it at all"
19200,Agree with the previous comment that it probably wasnt the pill that caused it  your hormones do change as you get older and that can result in acne.
19201,I had the exact same thing.
19202,"The pill can exacerbate acne but if you didn't notice a difference at all after you stopped taking it, then it probably wasn't making a difference."
19203,"If you are concerned, check which pill you were taking before  was it progestin only or combined?"
19204,"Progestin only pills are known for causing acne, although everyone reacts differently."
19205,"In which case, maybe try a combined one."
19206,"But speak to your doctor about your concerns, they will be able to tell you which specific pills are less androgenic and therefore less likely to cause acne."
19207,"You might have to try a few, but if your acne does come back only due to you trying a specific pill, it should disappear again once you stop it or try another."
19208,"local brand, Im from eastern europe75mcg Gestodene / 20mcg Ethinylestradiol"
19209,My whole life Ive struggled with gut issues.
19210,"Lately, Ive turned to chia seeds due to their fiber content."
19211,Ive been eating 2tablespoons a day in pudding.
19212,And its been great for my gut!!
19213,"Unfortunately, though, I noticed that i was cramping and breaking out."
19214,"Then I got my period, something I rarely get on the pill, which Ive been on for almost 3 years."
19215,"Ive only been having this chia seed pudding for a week, but now Im wondering whether it could lower the effectiveness of my birth control?"
19216,Im definitely reacting to it!!
19217,Im stopping the chia seed puddings now.
19218,Does anyone know whether I couldve compromised the effectiveness of my pill due to 2 tablespoons of chia seeds a day?
19219,I have chia seeds in my yogurt for breakfast all the time and never had any issues with it when I was on the pill

19225,Thank you!
19226,"Edit chia seeds have phytoestrogen, which I didnt even consider when I started eating them."
19227,There is so little info about how flaxseed/chia seeds affect birth control that I get mixed answers depending where I research.
19228,Everyday for breakfast!
19229,"i have read the pinned about this, but im still so baffled by the concept."
19230,"i recently saw this tiktoker who said she had no idea she was pregnant because she had no bump, had her period etc."
19231,"as someone w anxiety, this freaks me out i take bc pills  condoms and im quite sure they are effective, but things like this make me doubt myself."
19232,It's very uncommon.
19233,And she did not get her period while pregnant.
19234,"She may have had some bleeding that she mistook for periods, but you do not menstruate while pregnant."
19235,"Taking a pregnancy test (once a month at most) could help ease your anxiety a little bit, but you will almost certainly not experience a cryptic pregnancy."
19236,"This happened to a great aunt of mine, but her situation was a little bit different."
19237,She was in her late 40s and starting to go through menopause so she assumed that was the reason for the lack of periods.
19238,"She didnt show much, just got a little bit wider iin the stomach area, but just thought that was middle age spread."
19239,"She had some indigestion after dinner one night and had a baby a couple hours later!She had an adult son who was a bit of a compulsive liar so when he told us the news, we didnt believe him."
19240,"Turns out, he wasnt wrong that time For an average young person, Id say this is almost impossible though."
19241,Especially using two kinds of protection!
19242,She didnt use any because she felt she didnt need it (my nosy grandma definitely asked hahaha)
19243,"It happens because people mistake the very light bleeding that can happen when the cervix is irritated during pregnancy as a period.Also it could be they tested wayyy too early and thought they were in the clear, which is why the whole 14 days with the first morning pee or 4 hour pee hold, or 21 days after the last sex for a definitive answer is a thing And some women hold their babies differently than others, for example my aunt barely showed with full term babies, granted they were tiny little things at full term, like 4lbs5 1/2 pounds but still."
19244,"But one thing that is true is you cannot have a full flow period during pregnancy, it isnt possible."
19245,And if someone is pregnant and they have a full blown period they would need to go to the doctor.
19246,"Cryptic pregnancies are super super rare, and your doctor might even want to write a paper on you."
19247,"TV shows makes it seem more likely than it is.If you want to test, go ahead."
19248,No big deal.
19249,You can buy tests in bulk from amazon.
19250,Dollar store tests are also acceptable.
19251,"I used to have bad anxiety and testing helped me to ""see"" my birth control working, and then gradually I tested less."
19252,"If youre really curious, watch Mama Dr Jones series on YouTube where she reacts to episodes of the show I Didnt Know I Was Pregnant!"
19253,She is hilarious but also very informative.
19254,My biggest question is the women that claimed to get their periods.
19255,How much they bled?
19256,When you google implantation bleeding it says it should be spotting or not even enough blood to stain your panties.
19257,So how on earth did they mistake that for a period?
19258,Or are these women actually bleeding more or are their regular periods this light?
19259,"Anyways, it does happen and I know someone who it happened to."
19260,"However, its very unlikely and with the precautions youre taking its basically impossible."
19261,Im an ultrasound tech  I have had quite a few patients like this.
19262,My most recent one was a woman in the ER who was having abdominal pain and pelvic pain with some pressure.
19263,Doctor put in a pelvic ultrasound order and I go to the patient and we talk and she tells me her symptoms.
19264,"She lifts her stomach and shes a slender girl, but I noticed she looked a little bloated."
19265,"Nothing crazy, just bloated like after you eat a big meal or youre on your period."
19266,I put my probe down and boom a whole ass baby.
19267,I started to measure the baby and it was 31 weeks.
19268,She figured it out pretty quick and she started to hyperventilate.
19269,"She had her period the entire time, felt no movement, felt completely normal."
19270,It does happen.
19271,Its just not common.
19272,"It can happen if there's a perfect storm of already having weird periods (usually very light  irregular), having no symptoms or another medical condition that could explain symptoms, and testing too early or not at all.This last point is crucial if you take a pregnancy test at the right time (21 days after sex) the result will be accurate regardless of symptoms, birth control use etc.Be careful if you want to research cryptic pregnancies further, because there are some internet communities that claim you can have false negatives or an ultrasound showing nothing in the uterus well into the pregnancy."
19273,"That is not true, those people are usually either desperate to become pregnant or terrified of it so they make up this sort of thing.So I really wouldn't worry about it."
19274,"The chance of you getting pregnant with your two methods of birth control is 0.01 if you use both correctly, and it's usually pretty obvious when condoms fail."
19275,"The chance of having a false negative result on top of that is basically zero (again assuming the test is taken at the right time)Some sources    If you are still afraid of being pregnant despite using precautions and testing, this link might be useful especially if these thoughts are obsessive"

19282,"Some women have a second uterus, wouldnt it be possible in that case?"
19283,It happened to my mom with me at age 28 but she had extremely irregular periods and any bleeding she considered her period she asked why she didnt have bump and apparently i was positioned more towards her back so they think thats why she only had a very small very unnoticeable bump (nurse said she had the same thing happen to her)
19284,Yes!!
19285,"I used to think it was crazy that a person could ever not realize theyre pregnant but if you have irregular periods, are on effective birth control, think youre too old to get pregnant, or have been told you arent fertileif someone thinks its impossible for them to be pregnant it wont occur to them at all."
19286,link(
19287,"Also, many people on the show assume that because they have fertility issues, it is impossible for them to get pregnant."
19288,So they dont use birth control at all and think they are just fine.

19290,"Assuming they're not on BC, I just assume they have irregular periods to begin with and don't think anything is abnormal when their period doesn't come for awhile."
19291,i had really bad irregular periods in my late teens.
19292,"i sometimes went months without a period or might just spotted a little, but no full on bleeding."
19293,I have a feeling that its mostly denial or like if life situations happened.
19294,Like oh I ate some bad food or other things like working more hours or things like that and brushing it off might contribute also to things like this.
19295,Only 1 in 2000 women have two uteruses (uteri?
19296,"), so that scenario on its own is exceedingly unlikely."
19297,"But even still, it should not be possible in those cases."
19298,The hormones released by the pregnancy in one uterus prevent ovulation( in both.
19299,"If you don't ovulate, you don't get a period("
19300,"Im very regular when off birth control however I dont get a period currently due to bc, so if it happened to me I wouldnt be as surprised but I keep hearing women who experience cryptic pregnancies saying that they got their period during their whole pregnancy, but they never explain how those periods looked like or if they happened around the same time every month."

19341,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
19342,I was so terrified to get my copper iud inserted due to all the horror stories online but decided that it was still the best choice for me.
19343,And I was worried for nothing.
19344,The insertion is uncomfortable but passed in under a minute and thats it.
19345,My periods are slightly heavier but no pain or anything.
19346,I feel amazing and dont have to worry about birth control anymore.
19347,I know all stories are valid and everyones experiences are different but I just wanted to post this so that there arent only negative ones online.
19348,Ive had a great experience and would recommend it to everyone who is looking into it.
19349,Im jealous lol I was in pain for days.
19350,I still cant sit up straight with out being in pain.
19351,My periods are heavier and longer then they have everrrr been and my cramping is awful.
19352,Not to mention I bleed after sex every single time to the point Ive just just stopped having it altogether.
19353,Its inserted properly  has not moved.
19354,Love my copper IUD and only have mildly heavier periods now.
19355,"Unfortunately, I didn't have a great experience with insertion."
19356,I nearly passed out on the table then spent the next several hours in the worst pain of my life before I caved and took the fattest edible.
19357,Can't be in pain if you're on another planet lolI would say it is as bad as the internet says it is for some people and for others it's not.
19358,You won't really know what experience you will have until you do it unforunately.
19359,It would be nice if there was some sort of pain management for people who have a harder time with it.
19360,Same here!
19361,"Insertion was painless, my doctor was amazing and kept me talking the whole time so it just felt like a deep cramp."
19362,"Past a year in, and dont regret a thing."
19363,The pill made me psychotic practically
19364,My world class gynecologist told me she wouldnt wish the copper IUD on her worst enemy so maybe it is as bad as people say  youre getting a metal rod shoved into your cervix with no medication.
19365,Its a barbaric procedure in the states.
19366,I agree with you (from my own experience)
19367,It absolutely is that bad lol Im sorry but I have done body suspension (yes like hanging from the ceiling) and I would do that again before getting an IUD again.
19368,"Im never doing an IUD because I am terribly scared of getting one put in without being knocked out, and that I cant just stop taking it like a pill or ring or patch."
19369,Im glad it wasnt terrible for you though.
19370,I got the cooper iud and the first time I had it inserted was awful (I went to PP because my gynecologist office didnt offer Paragard at the time because it was a Catholic hospital).
19371,The doctor couldnt get it in all the way and she had to make 3 attempts to get it in.
19372,Last attempt she manually dilated me with rods.
19373,Whole experience was awful.
19374,My legs were shaking after and the pain was just awful for the following 3 days.
19375,Intercourse was painful on the 5th day and I asked my friend who got her Paragard a month before me if she had pain during intercourse.
19376,My friend said she didnt have pain after the second day and she said she had intercourse the same day she got the iud.
19377,Immediately I knew I needed to go see a different doctor cuz something was clearly wrong and I also had that gut feeling that something was just off.
19378,So I went to the gynecologist office at the hospital (they merged and became separate from the hospital so they were now able to offer Paragard) because it hurt so bad and they did an ultrasound to find it wasnt even inserted all the way and was sitting on the lower part of my cervix.
19379,She took it out and put a new one in.
19380,Thankfully it was not as painful as the first time.
19381,It was a relatively smooth and easy process.
19382,Part of me wishes I never messed with getting one to begin with.
19383,Been painful and honestly scary because for all I know the first doctor could have really did some serious damage but well find out when I go back to the dr this week.All in all I had one good experience and one bad.
19384,My advice is to go to a gynecologist who has many years of experience.
19385,I wish I had waited and went with my regular gynecologist office
19386,Also same.
19387,"I forgot to take my painkiller before insertion, but waxing hurts more than how much it hurt for insertion."
19388,I was having horrible cramps for about 30 minutes after insertion.
19389,"But my doctor's office let me lie down on a bed, gave me a painkiller and a candy and then after the painkiller started doing it's job, I could go back home by public transportation."
19390,But I think it depends on how heavy/painful your periods are to begin with.
19391,My doctor confirmed 3 times with me that I do not already get very heavy and very painful periods.
19392,"I have a friend who gets both and the doctor said IUD is not for her.I'm in Germany, BTW."
19393,I have two copper IUDs.
19394,"I had mildly heavier periods for 36 months, no cramping and the insertion was a strong cramp."
19395,I loved having so many years of reliable hormone free birth control.
19396,My daughter is getting one next week.
19397,She is 6 weeks post partum.
19398,I have the copper iud.
19399,Im iffy.
19400,"Only because i get severe cramps sometimes where i legit double over, it started when i got the iud."
19401,"It could be a cyst or something else, the cramps only happen 1 day before/during my period and thats it."
19402,Which i think is so weird so idk if its a cyst bursting or if thats just how i react because i never feel pain off my period.
19403,Ive honestly just come to terms with it and let it take its course.
19404,Insertion for me was fine actually and it didnt hurt at all!
19405,"I do think that when i get it taken out, i wont ever get a new one put in."

19409,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
19410,I have got one and In ways I think its barbaric but in other ways I am glad to have it.
19411,Its something you can essentially set and forget and I have great periods on it.
19412,"However, Ive just found out Im anemic which I may have already been so before getting it and its clearly meant that my body has not taken well to the extra copper inside me."
19413,For me copper excess in my blood caused a tonne of hormonal issues worse than when I was on the pill and 3 weeks out of 4 I was a depressed anxious bloated greasy asexual mess.
19414,I also had such bad inflammation that I was having uti like symptoms that was not a uti.
19415,Possibly I had pelvic inflammatory disease which Im waiting to hear back about but this can happen with any iud.
19416,"I have started on a cocktail of supplements  zinc to bring the inflammation down and reduce copper levels, iron (at a different time of day since it reduced zinc absorption) to get my iron levels up, and maca to balance my hormones again."
19417,I started zinc first which I did notice a brilliant improvement the inflammation calmed down and I could feel pleasure on my clit again.
19418,My dry eyes also got better.
19419,Anything copper related got better but the copper had already wreaked its havoc so my hormonal issues were not improving.
19420,I started maca less than a week ago and I feel like a different person.
19421,My experience wont be many peoples experience but I was just talking to another girl whos anemic who has had a similar experience to me.
19422,I didnt know I was anemic before but I wouldnt be surprised if I have been anemic for years and my body has there for not taken well to the extra copper.
19423,"If I can fix the issues which I think I am slowly and have noticed great improvement, I will keep it because I wont have to think about birth control and I wont have to be on hormonal birth birth control that messes with you."
19424,However I agree its a barbaric thing and dont let anyone tell you copper doesnt affect your hormones and your body!
19425,At least with this I can fix everything then stay on the zinc every other day to keep inflammation and copper levels at bay.
19426,I hate hormonal birth control as it just fucks everything up
19427,Everyones experience is different.
19428,Mine was the most significant disorientating pain Ive ever felt in my life and that level of intensity lasted hours.
19429,Same with Mirena.
19430,"I got the copper iud and insertion was a slight bit uncomfortable for me as well , but tolerable."
19431,It was the after effects that kinda fucked me up.The first week after insertion i was a bleeding mess(really heavy flow) and had the most horrendous cramps that i thought i had outgrown from my teen years.
19432,I spent 2 whole weeks laying in bed from the cramps alone.
19433,"After month 2 on it, no more cramping and my periods became much lighter than before i was on the copper iud."
19434,I was surprised because i was told by my obgyn that the hormonal iud was the one that causes lighter periods and that the copper iud causes heavier periods.
19435,100 agree!
19436,"Sure, the insertion was painful."
19437,"But for me, I was only in pain for about 10 minutes with minor cramping way better than the hormonal one I had before!"
19438,And its SO MUCH BETTER than any BC Ive had.
19439,Going nonhormonal was and is the right choice for me!
19440,"Agreed, like it's uncomfortable but really not nearly as bad as some would have you believe."
19441,(I understand everyone's experience is different and this is not to undermine people who had a difficult time)
19442,"I agree it, insertion wasnt bad for me tbh."
19443,"But I had to take it out after a year or so cos I was bleeding so much, I literally bled one time for 2 weeks and was like thats it lol and it stopped as soon as I took it out."
19444,I also became anemic.
19445,So if youre gonna use it Id recommend increasing your iron intake
19446,I love mine!
19447,"After not being able go use hormonal birth control due to other health factors, it was my only option."
19448,I was EXTREMELY scared about insertion and side effects.
19449,I made sure to go to an OBGYN that had good insertion reviews.
19450,I requested an anti anxiety medication prior to the procedure as well.
19451,She had me cough during specific parts and it honestly wasnt much worse than a pap smear.
19452,"everyone is different but if anyone is about to get one/looking to get one, google ONLY positive reviews or experiences of the insertion!"
19453,anxiety made mine worse
19454,Agreed!
19455,Mine made no difference and was not painful at all.
19456,10/10 recommend
19457,Your title is misleading af.
19458,Every BODY is different.
19459,I almost passed out during insertion and My body violently rejected it a few days later.
19460,10/10 worse than child birth.
19461,Everyone I spoke to when I was in the hospital told me leaking and heavy bleeding through pads every 1015 min is normal with iuds.
19462,They suggested buying DIAPERS.
19463,"Girl, fuck you!"
19464,I was also so scared from reading the horror stories online.
19465,"My story is on my page, but long story short, insertion felt like baby cramps, worst part was the vasovagal response  passing out on the table for an hour."
19466,"However, I was used to passing out on my period anyways!"
19467,I have the Kyleena.
19468,Although my periods are light /nonexistent I do wanna say my cramps are random  not that fun.
19469,Ive noticed drinking  constipation worsens my cramps.
19470,My insertion was relatively painfree.
19471,Felt like a mild period cramp.
19472,I was able to walk out of the appointment but I did take the day off nonetheless.
19473,"I spotted heavily every day for a few weeks and for the first few months my period was heavier, longer and crampier."
19474,It's been over a year since then and my period has since gone back to normal.
19475,"I was very anxious for the first few months about expulsion and using tampon, but I got used to it and it ended up being fine."
19476,"So it's been really good, however for the first few months I REALLY struggled with recurring BV and yeast infections."
19477,It was to the point where I was ready to have it removed but my gynecologist talked me out of it and said there are ways to prevent it.
19478,Thankfully the infections stopped but my discharge is still quite heavy.
19479,Other than that I'm very happy with it.
19480,"My fianc says he can't really feel it, only at certain angles so, yeah."
19481,I am fine with insertion.
19482,The amount of blood is almost untenable.
19483,I have had more leaks/accidents despite trying new products etc to deal with the excessive periods.
19484,Not yet a fan (also had a failed mirena where I just never stopped bleeding all month long for a year).
19485,"I've had mine for 9 years, and it hurt a bit on the day of insertion, but it's really never been a problem since."
19486,"I have not experienced excruciating period pain, not experienced lots of bleeding (any more than normal), and I have only recently begun to have changes in my periods, which is probably owing to the fact that I'm almost 37."
19487,"I just went to the gyno last week and got it all checked outParagard is still looking good, and I can wait until we hit the 10year mark next August to decide whether I want another or to do something different."
19488,I had the same experience!!
19489,"I was also very cautious from hearing and reading stories about how bad insertion and periods are, but both ended up being totally fine for me and I was really surprised."
19490,"Insertion was only a little bit uncomfortable, and my periods are almost the same except slightly longer and with a couple of bonus cramps."
19491,"I'm so glad it worked out for me, because I didn't want to deal with side effects from hormones, and it's also the lowest effort way to do birth control."
19492,"I'm guessing that for most people, if their birth control is working fine, then they won't bother posting about it on reddit, which is why there are more negative stories."
19493,Same here.
19494,Hormonal IUDs were so much worse for me.
19495,You may have had an allergy to progesterone.
19496,I was in constant pain with the hormonal IUD but I genuinely forget about the copper IUD.
19497,"Drove myself to the appointment, got it inserted, and left to go back to work with no issues."
19498,Insertion wasn't the bad aside from the intense anxiety (I was sexually assaulted back in December).
19499,"Cramps are worse than the pill and the bleeding is absolute murder, like how is it even possible!"
19500,Thankfully the menstrual cup does wonders so it's not a big deal.
19501,It's month four and suddenly I am getting absolutely horrendous lower back pain after being four days late.
19502,It's debilitating and has continued past my period.
19503,If it doesn't subside the IUD is out.
19504,It is coming in waves and has legit brought me to my knees twice.
19505,Appointment next week to see what the heck is up.
19506,I had the same experience!
19507,"Insertion pain was over very quickly, mild cramps for a couple days, and my only other side effect has been a heavier flow."
19508,Monthly cramps are not particularly worse than they were before and my period is actually a couple days shorter than before (Id sometimes bleed lightly for 10 days at a time on birth control).
19509,I thankfully had an ok experience.
19510,Was it painful?
19511,Fuck yes  extremely.
19512,"But the bad pain was gone within 30 seconds to a minute, however long it took her to put it in."
19513,"The cramps afterwards were pretty bad, but I think that was because I hadn't had a period in about 3 years so I had to get used to cramps again."
19514,"But I just went home and got a hot water bottle, comfort food and a nap."
19515,"It's not an ideal experience, but I'd do it again if it means not having to worry about contraception for 5 years or so."
19516,"Not trying to be provocative and you need not answer, but why have you not removed it?"
19517,"If you arent even having sex anymore because of it then theres no benefit of it, right?"
19518,"I say this as someone who has  s t r u g g l e d  with my copper IUD (horrific insertion and now 910 day bloodbath periods, terrible cramping all cycle long, etc) but has decided to keep it in bc Im still having regular sex and my cycles overall are long so I have a decent amount of time in between periods still."
19519,I had the exact same experience had to take and edible and slept all day.
19520,"My periods are heavier and more painful, now my cramp pain shoots into my thighs and makes me sick."
19521,My mom and sister said it gets better so Im hoping I have their experience too
19522,Definitely agree with that statement.
19523,I just dont feel it fair that theres only on the internet.
19524,I just wanted to put my story out.
19525,Im sure Im not the only woman in the world who felt it wasnt as bad.
19526,Worked for me I guess different people have different experiences !
19527,world class gynaecologist  she sure dispenses biased advice!
19528,Its personal.
19529,I just wanted to share my experience and it was not bad at all.
19530,And I would get another IUD without second thoughts
19531,Im in Germany too
19532,Did you get one post partum?
19533,Im getting one at my 6 weeks appointment.
19534,It's very common for the copper IUD to increase bleeding and cramping
19535,Ive heard about that.
19536,I had really heavy bleeding the second day after getting the iud.
19537,I also have an iron deficiency and assuming that could be why idk.
19538,I keep having issues with mine since I got it.
19539,Sorry that was your experience.
19540,But its not mine.
19541,"As I wrote in my post, I didnt experience pain and my period is only slightly heavier."
19542,Still using normal tampons and do sports and enjoy my life with the copper iud.
19543,And I think my story is also important to hear.
19544,Not only the negatives.
19545,There are positive stories with this birth control method.
19546,Tbh (and slight TW) I have a very deep fear of getting pregnant from a sexual assault again and it helps ease my mind.
19547,"I think people would be less argumentative if you had just said it wasn't as bad as the Internet said it would be, FOR YOU."
19548,"Your thoughtfulness is great, and helpful, but the title you put is misleading and invalidates the experiences of so many more women."
19549,"Yes, there's some women like you who have no issues, but then there's some women who have AWFUL times with them, and a whole spectrum in between."
19550,"However, the reality that this commenter is trying to explain is that when there's this many people who have such horrific experiences, then regardless of there being some who do fine, there SHOULD be pain relief and pain prevention that actually works available for EVERYONE, so NO ONE has a bad experience."
19551,"Sharing your experience is just fine, just be careful that it's clear to others that it's YOUR personal experience."
19552,"No matter which was you spin it, it is bad medical practice in my country because women overall are not offered so much as a numbing shot or pain pill before having something shoved up their cervix."
19553,I mean she literally is one of the best in the entire United States considering I have a rare nerve disorder that required experimental treatment.
19554,The first one was 6 weeks post  partum and the 2nd was a replacement
19555,makes you wonder which is worse?
19556,At this point Id rather just have another child.
19557,For every 100 stories I hear about copper IUDS only one is positive.
19558,And your right it is important for people to know that they might be the lucky 1/100 like you claim.
19559,But there are 99 of us whove had a completely different experience.
19560,I think its more important to highlight the risk and complications as well as the fact that you will most likely experience very very very heavy bleeding.
19561,Im happy its working for you.
19562,Let the copper settle in a little OP.
19563,"That makes perfect sense, and Im so sorry to hear about your history of sexual assault."
19564,"Im glad you were able to access a long term birth control option that could give you some control over your uterus, and hope you are in a good place now!"
19565,Neither here and I got it done in Germany.
19566,My doctor said I could take a painkiller 1h before if I wanted to but I forgot so I didnt have anything.
19567,And I was totally fine
19568,Copper IUDs that have been a blessing to many would not have been prescribed by her.
19569,Blocking access to appropriate care.
19570,Im in healthcare I check my bias at the door.
19571,Did it hurt a lot at the 6 week appointment?
19572,Can you feel the IUD while exercising?
19573,I heard the cooper one is the one that hurts the most.
19574,Im 23 and i am so afraid to have kids one day
19575,Just because you were fine doesnt validate the horrible state of the current medical practice for this procedure.
19576,No shed still prescribe it because she listens to her patients but she doesnt mince words and actually offers appropriate medication (which I should mention varies when it comes to being covered by insurance).
19577,Way to assume though.
19578,Are you a doctor that performs these procedures?
19579,I did not feel the IUD when exercising or any time.
19580,I would check the string after my period every month.
19581,The 6 weeks post partum was not bad.
19582,I went with my baby and she slept through it.
19583,I drove my baby and me home after.
19584,It was just a strong pinch/cramp for 30 seconds or so.
19585,Id rather buy diapers for a newborn than sleep in depends and soil my sheets and clothing with blood at 34
19586,I honestly dont think we need numbing and pain medication for everything.
19587,Just my opinion.
19588,No hate here
19589,Im a nurse that offers pills/patches/rings/depot to youth under 25 and refers to a doc to insert iuds if thats the clients preference.
19590,If I knew the doc was telling them they wouldnt wish the iud on their worst enemy I would report them and ensure we had a provider willing to offer unbiased care supported in science.
19591,Do you know what I wouldnt wish upon my worst enemy who was 16?
19592,A baby.
19593,And for some youth copper iud is the only option.
19594,Just dont wanna go through vaginal tearing and all the other complications.
19595,I have a blood clotting disorder so Im a bit scared for getting pregnant
19596,I think youre purposely missing the point and I wish I could say Im surprised.
19597,Doctors are allowed to have opinions have the barbaric state of womens healthcare.
19598,This has nothing to about refusing a service but being honest about how shit womens healthcare is.
19599,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge."
19600,"Hey guys, i wanted to hop on here and tell people weight loss is not impossible on nexplanon, i got the rod while already being in a calorie deficit, and if anything, its sped up the weight loss."

19614,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
19615,I hear about such wildly different experiences with birth control both online and in daily life!
19616,"Birth control, hormonal or nonhormonal (except condoms) is obviously such an individual experience and seems really unpredictable  but there has to be some way to get a sense of how it'll affect you before you start, right?"
19617,"For example, if I know I have really intense bloating before and during my menstrual phase, could I reasonably assume that I'll have a higher chance of significant weight gain if I start hormonal birth control?"
19618,Or could I assume I won't have terrible cramps on the copper IUD because I normally don't have cramps on my period at all?Just some speculation and would love to hear thoughts!
19619,"Currently trying to figure out if I want to start BC, so im just trying to gather info and see if there are any trends!"
19620,Unfortunately there is no way at all to predict it.
19621,You just need to try something and adjust as needed.
19622,"When it comes to IUDs, both hormonal and nonhormonal, an internal ultrasound scan can help a lot."
19623,"So first an internal, ultrasound scan BEFORE deciding which shape and size is the best IUD size for you.Unfortunately even in countries where there are a plethora of IUD sizes available not every doctor follows the best practices, so I understand your doctor might also not care to do an ultrasound scan before deciding on the IUD size..."

19633,This really helps
19634,"So after reading the leaflet that comes with a combination pill (Ethinylestradiolum  Levonorgestrelum), I have three seemingly easy questions which I can't really wrap my head around1."
19635,"It reads that after finishing the full pack of 21 tablets, it may take up to two days before the bleeding occurs."
19636,"Why are you protected from pregnancy during those 48h, then?"
19637,"How is it different from just skipping two days and having unprotected sex any other time within the pack, then?"
19638,2.
19639,"It also reads that if one's just starting birth control, if you take the pill between 2nd and 5th day of your cycle, you need to take it for full 7 days before you can have unprotected sex."
19640,It does not have the same disclaimer for using it on consecutive cycles  why is that?
19641,"Why do I need to wait 7 days when I take it the first time and I'm not protected while on my second period on the pill, if I take it after the 7day break, I'm protected immediately?3."
19642,"Why does it matter if you take it on the first day of your period (whcich results in it being effective immediately, even if you're just starting birth control) or between 2nd and 5th (which results in you needing to take it for full 7 days before it works)?"
19643,That's a line that the leaflet draws.I just can't find logical answers to those questions so I hope you'll shed a light! )
19644,You do know you're covered for the 7 day break between runs of 21 pills?
19645,"So if you take the prescribed 2q days, 7 day pill break, 21 days, 7 day break etc you're never unprotected, it's just a withdrawl bleed you have in the 7 day gap not a true period"

19649,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
19650,Yeah I know but that's also part of what I don't understand like I said.
19651,I am protected for the 7 day break but why?
19652,How is it different for me to miss 2 days during those 21 vs. having the regular 23 days of limbo at the end of the pack before the bleeding happens?
19653,Why does the former result in chances of getting pregnant while the latter does not?
19654,"This post covers a lot of great points, and your questions are among them!"
19655,I was confused by this too at first!
19656,basically youre protected during the 7 day break because youve had the previous 21 days of active pills.
19657,"if you miss for example day 11, youve only had 10 days of active pills therefore more risk of getting preggers hope that makes sense!"
19658,I cant really explain the hormone level side of things but I think climaciellabrunnea did a good job!
19659,"I believe it is because if you miss 23 of the 21 pills your body (who usually wants to pop out an egg) might have a little breakthrough surprise ovulation because of the mini drop in hormones this is why rhey say after missing 2 days you need to take 7 pill days again to ensure you are protected and your ovaries are sleeping for sure.But on the 7 day pill breaks, the hormone drop off is a bit of surprise after a looong time of consistency, which tells your uterus to drop whatever its got in there and simulates a bleed."
19660,"The bleeds are eggless, hence why they arent considered true periods."
19661,You are considered safe for the 7 days IF you continue again with the next set of 21 pills daily and effectively.
19662,"And also because if you bleed out your endometrial lining on your withdrawals then any fertilized egg that slipped through would have incredible difficulty attaching.Sometimes you wont bleed, and thats okay!"
19663,The pill thins the lining that much sometimes that theres nothing to drop.
19664,"That, and I've learned that taking a pregnancy test once a month for peace of mind is worth it haha!I hope this helps, this is all really just from my understanding!"
19665,"Got my appointment for nexplanon fitted this afternoon, any last minute bits of advice?"
19666,Short sleeves?
19667,How long does the appointment last?
19668,When does the numbing wear off?
19669,Once the doctor is in it took me maybe 1015 mins?
19670,I wore a tank top to make it easier.
19671,"They told me the numbing would wear off in maybe 34 hours, but I didnt feel any intense pain even afterward besides my arm being a bit sore when making big movements (raising it up etc)."
19672,"They recommended no heavy lifting for a week after cause your arm may be sore, but u can safely exercise depending on how you feel.Also shower beforehand."
19673,"Theyll put a bandage and a gauze over your arm, the gauze you have to keep on for 24 hours and try not to get it wet then (I just showered with my arm out if water), but the bandage underneath you should leave for 5 days total from memory."
19674,Have some spare waterproof bandages ready that Yu can replace it with in case you get it wet.
19675,"This is all to minimise infection in the open site, getting it wet wont impact efficacy.Youll be fine!"
19676,"The numbing injection was the hardest part for me, the actual insertion hardly hurt because of the numbing )"

19684,"I got mine without numbing, wasn't too bad either!"
19685,Make sure to avoid sleeping on that arm mostly and you're fine.
19686,It can get sore still after it has healed.
19687,Hi everyone I had been on micronelle (combined pill) from 2021 until May this year.
19688,I still had usual withdrawal bleeds when I took the sugar pills which could be painful but nothing too bad.
19689,Recently (4 months ago) I swapped to slynd (mini pill) due to low iron.
19690,The dr suggested my iron may be low from the bleeds I was having on my pill and swapping to slynd would mean I would have very light if any bleeds.
19691,"I swapped and all was going well, no periods ect."
19692,However seggs became extremely painful.
19693,It is nothing to do with lube or my boyfriend literally 10 days after starting mini pill the pain started.
19694,It got so bad I couldnt do it for more then a minute without excruciating pain and redness and cuts.
19695,"I read this can happen from low dose BC because theres not enough oestrogen which can lead to dryness and pain, but I couldnt take it anymore."
19696,Last night I swapped back to my combined pill.
19697,I would like to know if anyone has experienced this sort of pain from mini pill or slynd?
19698,And if it went away?!?
19699,Im hoping itll stop now Im back on the combined pill but freaking out and fearing a life of painful seggs!
19700,And I want advice on how long till it may go back to normal!
19701,(I have never had paid with seggs or any trauma or emotional issues until the mini pill)

19706,Ive been off the combo pill since May.
19707,I had been on it since 2017.
19708,"28F.I never had issues orgasming with my husband but ever since going off the pill, my sex drive has been thru the roof."
19709,I could probably have sex at least 4 times a week compared to the once a week husband and I were at.Does this mean that the pill actually reduced my libido?
19710,"Because I would have said I had a pretty normal, unaffected libido before going off the pill."
19711,"But now that Ive been off it and want way more sex than before, Im confused."
19712,"Also, is wanting to keep my high sex drive a valid reason to not go back on BCP?"
19713,Is there another nonhormonal bc method I could use that isnt condoms?
19714,TIA!
19715,I had the same experience but I was on the implant.
19716,I noticed I got wetter when I was off bc.
19717,"I also dont want to get back on bc becase i enjoy my high sex drive ,wondering the same thing Lol"
19718,Learning about your cycle is the BEST non hormonal way to prevent pregnancy.
19719,"Learning how to chart with body temp, cervical fluid, and placement of the cervix is really great."

19732,Within 12 hours is ideal so that window ishould be fine.
19733,"But with such a large range, you might consider a different time just to make it easier to be consistent and try to have a smaller hour range just in case in the long term, maybe when you start your next pack you can try when you wake up in the morning ?"
19734,"When you take the pill at the same time each day it helps to keep hormone levels consistent, so I would personally try to find a suitable time where you can take it at the same time each day, or at least a smaller window than 6 hours (23 maybe )."

19762,"TLDR I CANNOT get this ring to stay in place, what advice do you have?"
19763,I am on continuous birth control to help with my awful periods.
19764,"I have been using the patch for a few years now, but I couldnt go more than two months without breakthrough bleeding."
19765,"The only way I could ever get it to stop was by taking a week off the patch, and then Id have a horrible period."
19766,"Otherwise I loved the patch, my only side effect was sore boobs every once in a while."
19767,"I just switched to a new doctor, and my goal is to actually get answers for why my periods are awful and why I have almost pelvic pain, but he wanted me to try a new kind of birth control first to see if it would help before we try something like surgery to see whats going on."
19768,So Im trying the ring.
19769,Im on day 4.
19770,Heres where I need some help.
19771,I CANNOT get this thing to stay in place.
19772,Ive tried pushing it in as far up as I can get it.
19773,"I can get it in pretty far, but it always works its way back down."
19774,Its always poking out.
19775,Ive tried folding it a couple of ways including the figure 8 and in half methods.
19776,No matter what Ive done it is always poking back outside of me within an hour of adjusting.
19777,"Its uncomfortable, I can feel it moving around, and Im concerned that it constantly poking out or me constantly readjusting it will lead to BV or a yeast infection."
19778,"I wash my hands of course, but still."
19779,I have three months of patches left from the last time I got my prescription and Im considering just switching back.
19780,"I do want to give the ring a solid try, but so far this has been ridiculous."

19797,Im currently on both the depo and the IUD (whilst I wait for the depo to wear off).
19798,I havent had periods on the depo and was wondering what stage of the menstrual cycle this would technically be.
19799,Any thoughts?
19800,"If you dont have periods, youre not having a menstrual cycle"
19801,"Depo stops your cycles, if you dont have a period you dont have a menstrual cycle."
19802,IUDs you do technically usually ovulate.
19803,If you havent had a period since being on the shot you arent at any stage.

19811,Im not sure what your question is.
19812,Nope it works by stopping ovulation which is why you dont have a period.
19813,You may feel like you are experiencing different stages with other symptoms.
19814,But your not actualy having any kind of cycle.
19815,While ur not having periods ur not having a cycle and if you end up with some kind of bleeding wether its regular or not you wont be ovulating.

19820,Soo I got on the depo shot 3 months ago and it was good!
19821,I didnt get a period for the time being and I loved it but now Im experiencing irregular (very light) bleeding for 11 days now and I hate it I dont even want to get my second shot bc Im kinda nervous Ill have to experience that again / plus the random irregular bleeding is an inconvenience to me but one thing that makes me not want to leave it is the going back to how period felt like before BC and it was unbearable!
19822,Like I mean passing out unbearable which is the one thing Im not really too mad at the irregular bleeding Im experiencing now bc it was 1  off  on and 2  the symptoms I experience while irregularly bleeding now are waaay more tolerable than before.
19823,Im seeing my gyno next week but any advice to help the irregular bleeding in the meantime would b very much helpful

19828,Hi all.
19829,Ive been on the birth control pill for around 7 years now.
19830,This year I switched to Yaz.
19831,I came back from living abroad in last December and had a horrible phase of culture shock through February.
19832,It was so bad my doctor started treating me for a bipolar disorder (We just didnt know the right diagnosis at first).
19833,Anyways the reason I mentioned this is because every month since Ive had episodes of extreme anxiety/hysteria within a week of starting my period.
19834,Its usually one pretty bad episode at night accompanied with a day or two of insecurities and sad mood.
19835,I only just noticed that its basically in sync with my periods.
19836,Happens only a few days before my period starts.
19837,Has anyone had this before?

19846,I was on Tricera Lo (low hormonal) birthcontrol for about 2 years or a little longer.
19847,I went off of it 4 months ago just to cleanse my system and not have anything in it.
19848,I didnt notice any weight gain when I was on the pill since it was low hormone.
19849,I feel like I have gained a bit of weight now being off of it?
19850,Which I usually thought you have the opposite reaction (gain weight on the pill.)
19851,In highschool I was on a regular hormone dose and gained weight but not this time around with Tricera Lo.
19852,Has anyone else experienced this?

19910,This is simply a rant.
19911,Ive been on a low dosage estrogen bc pill for almost 2 years now.
19912,"Since January, Ive become so much more moody, get angry so easily, and dont feel like myself."
19913,Im ruining my relationship because I get enraged at the dumbest stuff.
19914,"I know people will say its other things, but Ive narrowed it down from all other medications and reasons I could be like this."
19915,My hormone levels and everything is fine I found out in a blood test just to be sure.
19916,I literally hate this pill.
19917,Im basically holding out until my insurance approves me to get the low dosage Kyleena IUD that my OBGYN suggested when I told her all these symptoms last week.
19918,I know its also a hormonal form of bc but she told me we will try it based on what Ive described to her.
19919,I hate myself because of this pill.
19920,My anxiety is worse and I beat myself up more after every mistake.
19921,I hate who Ive become because of it.
19922,I wish I could just quit altogether but I cant risk getting pregnant right now.
19923,This is ruining me.
19924,"Im crying as I write this.Anyway, I dont know if anyone else has felt this way, but Im sorry I just needed to rant to people who understand how hard it is.Edit I know Im really emotional right now and my husband has repeatedly told me Im not ruining our relationship."
19925,But the pill (and already having an anxiety disorder) make me lie to myself thinking that I am in fact ruining it.
19926,Im sorry about this long post and no one will likely respond but I just needed to get it out.
19927,Thanks in advance
19928,Never underestimate the emotional toll birth control can have on you.
19929,I would definitely consider trying a nonhormonal birth control option like the copper IUD if I were you.
19930,This is not worth your mental health.Also keep in mind hormonal blood tests rarely provide answers.
19931,"Your hormones fluctuate throughout your cycle, and even though you could be in a normal range, it doesn't mean you are in an optimal range for your body."
19932,There are tons of different hormones and formulations of birth control.
19933,Just because this one was bad doesnt mean theyll all be!
19934,You could try the progesterone only pill as well if youre worried about the IUD.
19935,I would highly recommend trying a non pill methods.
19936,"Pills just really dont work well for some people, Im one of those."
19937,"I loved the Nuvaring and IUD though, the constant hormones were a lot better for me and my mental health"
19938,Ohhh girl I have felt this way for a long time.
19939,I wish I could just get sterilised easy and not have to deal with birth control anymore.
19940,"Even the copper iud isnt completely innocent, infact its caused more issues than the pill for me!"
19941,"So now Im just like hmm, idk where to go next I need protection so Im keeping it for now but yeah."

19947,Thats true too!
19948,Thats a good point.
19949,"Sorry, its just been so hard lately."
19950,I feel hopeless sometimes.
19951,That sounds so encouraging thank you.
19952,My OB is having me try the low dosage Kyleena IUD.
19953,"Also, if I can ask you, did you experience weight gain on the pill?"
19954,And then noticed that your weight came back down with the IUD?
19955,Im sorry youre struggling with bc too  its so much trial and error it seems.
19956,Im hoping that the low dosage Kyleena IUD that my OB suggested will be better for me.
19957,Im so tired of having to figure out whats the least awful option basically.And Im with you I want to get sterilized too but I know that my husband and I may want kids in the future.
19958,And I just looked up how expensive it is to freeze your eggs too.
19959,I know a lot of people who get the DUTCH test done which is a comprehensive hormonal panel.
19960,It's not cheap though.
19961,"There are cheaper options, like EverlyWell and Proov."
19962,These won't be helpful for you until you get off birth control though your hormones will reflect the hormones in your birth control pill.
19963,"You have to take these hormonal tests roughly 3 months after getting off birth control.If I were in your shoes, I would probably get on a good multivitamin and prebiotic/probiotic."
19964,"Birth control can negatively impact your gut health and deplete nutrients, so taking care of that would be a good first step."
19965,"Also, if you are interested in finding nonhormonal birth control options, I highly suggesting looking into the Fertility Awareness Method."
19966,There are a lot of good books/resources explaining how it works.
19967,"Yeah, hormones can mess with our ability to cope and think clearly about our problems."
19968,"I'd def say get off this pill, see if you return to baseline, then try something else!"
19969,"I lost weight(but I also had some eating issues that contributed), i gained a slight bit of water weight on the IUD but it came off after a few months"
19970,I know I wont ever want kids but being 25 I think itll be hard
19971,Thanks so much for explaining the testing!
19972,"That makes sense that it would take a few cycles off of bc to see the results being accurate.As for the fertility method, I get so nervous about this and fearing that Ill mess it up."
19973,Ill absolutely look into the prebiotic and probiotic supps too.
19974,Ill read up more on this natural fertility method because I may just switch to that if the Kyleena IUD doesnt work out like my OB suggested.
19975,Thanks so much
19976,Youre right.
19977,"Thank you, friend Im switching to Kyleena IUD at the lowest dosage by my OBs recommendation when I told her what Im dealing with."
19978,Im hopeful but nervous.
19979,I really hope this one works for me and helps me feel normal again.
19980,That makes sense for sure.
19981,I think if I had to guess but my pill bc is estrogen rn  I suspect that its increasing my sugar cravings thus leading to weight gain.
19982,Im hoping the intense cravings throughout the month will subside.
19983,Thats good you know that though!
19984,I go back and forth about having kids tbh so who knows
19985,I was definitely worried about FAM too before I started.
19986,"I was one of those people who saw ads for Natural Cycles and other FAMrelated things and thought, ""All these people will be pregnant by next month"" But after reading more about how the female body works and especially ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility,"" I 100 believe that it is a reliable birth control method."
19987,"If you do start FAM, or even just want to keep track of your cycles, moods, and other parts of your health, I would recommend downloading the app Kindara."
19988,"It allows you to track your cycles, exercise, medication, and is great for FAM."
19989,"It has temperature charts, cervical fluid tracking, etc."
19990,"I've never felt more intune with my body than I have with FAM, but I also understand that it requires more work than your average bc method."
19991,I do think IUDs are incredible as well.
19992,Thats awesome!
19993,"I briefly used Natural Cycles a few years ago when it was relatively new, and I just got paranoid that I wasnt doing it right."
19994,Id be willing to try it again and read the information you shared and that app you mentioned.
19995,I just want my body to feel like me again.
19996,"Thankfully, my periods were relatively bearable without bc so I think it would be okay.Im hoping the IUD is a positive experience but after 36 months if Im just feeling awful and hating the side effects, Ill consider FAM again for sure."
19997,"21 F, i have been on oral pills for about 34 months and have a period of 5 days between every month for withdrawal bleeding."
19998,"Last month I had withdrawal bleeding which started on the 31st and continued till around 5thI started taking my pills again, however this time due to personal reasons I stopped taking it after 4 days and I'm getting my withdrawal bleed again and it's a lot of blood Should I be worried about too much blood loss since I technically started my bleeding twice in a month?"

20003,So I got my iud out on August 30th and on the 31st I got the Implanon/nexplanon in my armInserted.
20004,I was supposed to get my period the first of September and since then I have been bleeding.
20005,Is my new birth control effective yet?
20006,Nexplanon is effective 7 days after insertion.
20007,The bleeding varies for each person.I had a coworker that bled for a year straight and another one that bled for about 3 months.
20008,I personally have no bleeding yet (mine was inserted august 21st and my period was supposed to start on september 9th).

20013,Okay thank you so much.
20014,So is it okay to start having unprotected sex?
20015,Had two accidents in the last 30 days that required Plan B. I havent even had to take a plan b in YEARSits been a while since dealing with the aftermath.Each time the pills were taken within the 72 hour window.
20016,"Fast forward, Im about a week late and definitely feeling the stress."
20017,I know that my cycle is likely all messed up now but it is still freaky.
20018,Was super anxious and took a pee test yesterday and its neg.
20019,Am I being paranoid?
20020,"(Side note, seeing GYN to discuss IUD options at the end of month)"
20021,"Yes, youre being paranoid."
20022,By the time you miss your period due to pregnancy you would test positive.

20028,It is completely understandable.
20029,It sounds more like paranoia.
20030,"Just checking, were you around ovulation time when you had to take them?"
20031,And has it been over a week since you were supposed to get your period?
20032,If it hasn't been a week over I'd say I wouldn't worry too much.
20033,The IUD might be a good idea if you feel like it would give you peace of mind for the future tho
20034,appreciate it!
20035,"Unfortunately during the 2nd accident, it was near ovulation."
20036,Itll be 6 days late tomorrow.
20037,I am DEF being a little paranoid.
20038,I have been not been sexually active in over a year so its definitely all a lot.
20039,Thanks for the peace of mind!
20040,Oh my goodness.
20041,I'm so sorry... may your pregnancy tests be negative and your mindset positive girl
20042,Update?

20057,Take the one you missed asap.
20058,Especially if you are newly on it I would wait a little longer for him to actually finish in you.
20059,A week would be the wisest.
20060,If his pullout game is strong and you are not around the time you'd normally have ovulation you may be brave enough to try it.
20061,"I would not recommend it, but if you were to choose between finishing inside or out, I'd go with out."
20062,Best would be to wrap it up for now tho
20063,Depends on what pill you have / when you took it / when you will have it again.
20064,"If its the combined pill, you have a 12 hour window."
20065,"If you took it last night at 10pm, then you should have taken it at 10pm today, but you have a 12 hour window."
20066,"So if you take it before 10am tomorrow, you are still protected."
20067,But lots of pills are different so for sure read the pamplet and it should tell you
20068,I use Zafemy birth control patches.
20069,"This thing will not always stick to me, no matter where I put it, and the edges are always peeling by the end of the week."
20070,I've read other people having issues with the adhesive on this patch.
20071,I had to put a bandaid on it because after 2 hours it's already peeling up in a corner.

20078,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
20079,You cant use any other adhesive (including medical tape) to stick your patch on.
20080,The contraception is in the adhesive.
20081,If its not sticking to you its not protecting you.
20082,You might want to try changing your body wash if its really moisturizing.
20083,It could be leaving a film.
20084,"Similarly, make sure you havent used any form of lotion where your patch is going."
20085,If it still wont stick youll need to change methods as it isnt providing any protection.
20086,"As long as you know the patch is stuck to you, it's okay to use another thing to hold just the edges."
20087,"Whenever I'd put a new patch on, I'd put a layer of tegaderm on top which prevented it from lifting all week, which reduced my anxiety a lot."
20088,"The patch IS sticking to me, but the edges peel up."
20089,Why can't I use medical tape or bandages to hold down the edges?
20090,Because medical tape will give the illusion that the patch is sticking more than it is.
20091,The actual adhesive may unstick and you wouldnt know because the tape would be holding the patch in place.
20092,"That would leave you unprotected, potentially for long periods of time, greatly increasing pregnancy risk."
20093,"the final week in a pack of lo loestrin fe has three active pills, two estrogen only pills, and two placebo/iron only pills."

20120,And I know that well.

20139,And after that didnt see it till end of beginning of September.
20140,My doc said its pretty normal and in your case your body needs get rid of the hormones to get back to normal
20141,Mirena has a much higher amount of hormones than the other methods youve used (hence why you can keep it in for much longer) but its completely normal for your period to stop on Mirena.
20142,"I never had a period during the 2 years I had my Mirena, if youre not comfortable with that Id look into a combo form of birth control or non hormonal."

20172,Ive heard that getting off birth control can make your partner look more unattractive accordingly but does the opposite also apply?
20173,Locked.
20174,The studies in their area can not be replicated which means they are bad studies and should not be trusted.
20175,"The study on attraction is pretty bs, they just showed women on and off bc pictures of guys."
20176,In reality attraction is a lot more complex than a picture
20177,Some theorize so.
20178,"The main idea behind the studies is that because women on birth control don't ovulate, they may be less attracted to certain traits associated with high testosterone levels."
20179,"Overall, results are washy, and human attraction is very complex."

20185,Theres 0 robust evidence for this.
20186,People dont pick their partners based on pheromones.
20187,These studies also have very poor methodology.
20188,"Regardless, pheromone based studies have repeatedly failed replication and have been falsified numerous times."
20189,Dr. Sarah Hill and other bad actors are continuing to perpetuate these myths for profit.
20190,"Overly broad, overly fringe, unsubstantiated, and/or  runs counter to established medical knowledge."
20191,I was taught in my immunology class about body odor correlating with mating preferences.
20192,Same goes for partners will subconsciously choose someone who has the same immune system they do to produce similar/stronger offspring.
20193,"Im just sharing links relating to the science Ive been taught in medication altering not only hormones but immune system, body odor, pheromones, etc which alters our preference in who we find attractive."
20194,There does need to be more studies on the subject but the science is there from what Ive been taught/read about.
20195,I have an extensive background in psychology.
20196,"A lot of this is based in evopsych, which is a highly controversial field for good reason."
20197,There have been many studies looking at pheromones in human attraction and few have ever been successfully replicated.
20198,"It is incredibly important to keep in mind that the field of psychology has an ongoing replication crisis, and social psychology is particularly impacted."
20199,The paper you linked is not a study but a literature review/recap.
20200,"The most recent study referenced is from 2010, which is quite out of date."

20211,"If you are asking to track your period, yes."
20212,I'm less knowledgeable about the mini pill bc I wanted to off myself after a week so we switched to the combo pill.
20213,You obviously don't have a normal cycle of hormonal fluctuations but you can predict which days you'll likely get your period.
20214,Keep track of the day you get it and you'll know at the end of your pack that in 24 days you'll get it and which is more likely
20215,I made another post in the hysterectomy sub and everyone (understandably) said that getting the surgery was the last resort option and to try BC first.
20216,"In short, im 18 years old and get normal periods (35 days in length, 2830 days apart, not too intense pain compared to other people but i still get pain, etc)."
20217,"The thing is, while i do not think that periods are gross in any way, the whole idea of blood coming out of me makes me so uncomfortable and uneasy."
20218,"Even jf im not in physical pain, i want to just cry and scream cuz my period causes me so much distress and i just hate it so much!"
20219,Im considering getting on birth control to stop my periods for good (or for as long as i can) but Im just scared of starting.
20220,I dont know if something like the pills or iud would be better or the first step in getting one (would it just be to talk to my family doc?).
20221,Im also afraid of side effects.

20231,Hi!
20232,I use birth control to skip my period.
20233,I havent had a period in nearly 7 years.
20234,Combination birth control is probably the most consistent for skipping your period.
20235,"Combi birth control options include combo pills, the patch, and the ring."
20236,Be aware that some people have breakthrough bleeding (bleeding while taking active pills) with continuous use.
20237,Breakthrough bleeding usually stops/ improves after the first 3 months.
20238,"If your goal is absolutely zero periods, then the hormonal IUD may not be the best choice."
20239,"It only stops periods for about 20 of users, although it does make periods lighter and/or less frequent for most people."
20240,Side effects are hard to predict  the same birth control can be perfect for one person and horrible for another.
20241,"However, side effects are not permanent and theyre not inevitable (for example, Ive never had negative side effects)."
20242,The only way to know how your body will react is to try!
20243,Most side effects stop/ drastically improve in the first 3 months.
20244,I had to go on alesse for intense pain.
20245,It's a lower dose but you can skip and the third month you have a lighter one.
20246,The first day is trash but the rest are a breeze.
20247,I haven't had too bad of side effects personally.
20248,I originally tried the mini pill in the past and wanted to off myself so I'd say the combo is definitely better for me.
20249,I've noticed weight gain and wanting to eat more.
20250,I've also been extra sad.
20251,Taking vitamin d3 has eased that side effect some tho.
20252,I wouldn't recommend going on without another reason to but I understand not wanting to deal with your period every month.
20253,Haha tysmm!
20254,Ill look into that one!
20255,"So you didnt notice any negative changes at all (like acne, weight change, mood changes, etc) while using this?"
20256,Nope.
20257,I maybe had a little nausea the first week but I get nauseous a lot anyway lol.
20258,"YMMV tho, everyone is so different."
20259,Hi!
20260,So I started the pill a little over a year ago.
20261,(Isabloom) I never gained weight from being on it however I stopped taking it about a week ago and I swear my weight is up?
20262,Is this common/normal?
20263,I always thought birth control caused weight gain so I wouldnt think stopping it would make my weight increase!

20295,I took so much unnecessary Plan B when I was younger and it really messed up my cycles for a long time.
20296,"Just a huge dose of hormones on top of the pill, and not needed if youre taking your pills correctly."
20297,No one ever really educated me on that so I try to help others out.
20298,"Yeah same here, like my cycles were permanently lighter from plan b."
20299,"People think of it like a plan a option when it is in the name, and having both birth control on top of plan b is gonna give them a shit ton of side effects that they are really gonna feel and scare the shit out of them later"

20309,"You wont have a true period on a combo pill, youll have a withdrawal bleed once you reach your placebos, mine typically starts within a couple days of using them."
20310,"Always wise to take a test during that period just in case but BC is very, very effective when used correctly."
20311,Ahh thank you that clears things up for me
20312,"I went to Costa Rica to visit my boyfriend, lost my virginity, and I got slightly paranoid and took their version of Plan B (Posterga)."

20395,Google where you can find one in your area.
20396,Thank you so much.
20397,I found a pill with Ella that I ordered online to my local pharmacy.
20398,I was taking combination BCPs for 20 years.
20399,Two years ago my doctor switched me to Norethindrone and that worked well for 18 months.
20400,For the last 4 months I have been menstruating continuously and my OBGYN has recommended tubal ligation or Mirena.
20401,I am hesitant because of my family history.
20402,My mother almost died from bleeding when her IUD became dislodged and she hemorrhaged.
20403,Several family members became pregnant using the depo implants.
20404,"My doctor will no longer prescribe hormonal birth control because of my age, 40."
20405,"I believe that I would benefit from a higher dose progesterone pill, but the FDA does not approve what women have access to in the EU."
20406,"From what I have read, Mirena is unlikely to stop my bleeding continuously."
20407,Can anyone speak to their own experiences regarding these issues?
20408,I was on Norethindrone and it did the same thing to me.
20409,I got switched over to Slynd and haven't had any issues since.
20410,It doesn't contain estrogen.
20411,I think it is called Slynda in other countries?

20425,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
20426,Calendar tracking is not reliable in the best of times but especially not after huge hormonal shifts.
20427,r/FAMnNFP has good information on how to do actual fertility tracking but it might not be compatible with your current life.
20428,For it to be accurate you need to take your BBT every morning before moving from bed.
20429,"Having inconsistent sleep schedules can impact efficacy, as can sleeping for less than 3 uninterrupted hours before taking your temp."
20430,Condoms would be a much better option.
20431,"You could also get any progesteroneonly form of contraception, including the mini pill, implant or IUD."
20432,"Calendar is probably the worst method to use, its incredibly inaccurate as a calendar cannot determine when youre ovulating."
20433,"You need to be tracking ovulation whether by tracking with strips, CM, temping etc."
20434,and its always smart to double up with another method like condoms.
20435,You have to be ok with getting pregnant when youre using NFP
20436,For background Ive been taking birth control pills since high school so Ive been on them for 5 years now.
20437,I had normal/light periods before I was on the pill.
20438,I think a few months into taking birth control I pretty much stopped getting my period and then it totally stopped.
20439,Ive had a few months here and there since where Ive had tiny amounts of bleeding during the placebo week but nothing else.
20440,My doctor says this is normal and okay but a lot of my friends say their doctors have said it isnt normal (for similar situations theyve had) .

20448,its causing me so many symptoms and especially fatigue and headache/tension headaches.
20449,the last time my bf finished in me was about a week ago i wanna say and today i start my sugar pill.
20450,so really i was wondering when during my pack it the best time to stop?
20451,7 days after i start my new pack?
20452,finish my pack regular and just dont start the next one?
20453,take a another 3 weeks of active pills then just stop?
20454,im just a little confused bc im thinking would i still be protected if the last time we had sex was not even a week ago then i do my placebo week and would i still be okay if i dont do another 7 days of active/ first week of my next pack?
20455,yall get what im saying?
20456,someone help me out )))
20457,Generally it's easiest to stop at the end of a pack and just not start the next one.
20458,You should start using protection on the last day that you take an active pill.

20473,Hi!Ive been on the pill for 5 years now.
20474,"I was on tri Sprintec but due to migraines it was causing, my OB switched me to Slynd."
20475,It was all great and dandy until around 67 months in when I started really noticing the side effects.
20476,My libido was nearly non existent and I had crazy mood swings.
20477,I decided I wanted to stop the pill and see how much changes within my body.
20478,I skipped the placebo week and havent had an actual period since January.
20479,Ive only had minimal bleeding on days where I missed or took the pill later than usual (rarely for both).
20480,I stopped it 23 weeks ago and am just curious if anyone has any recommendations or advice?
20481,I havent gotten my period yet.
20482,"Ive been having some dull cramps and its been feeling a lot like if my uterus were a stomach, it would be full if that makes sense?"
20483,it kind of feels like that most of the time.
20484,Also tmi but Ive been having a lot more bowel movements since I stopped it.

20486,What other side effects are common?
20487,Is there anything I should be anticipating?

20505,Nah youll be good
20506,I got Mirena a few days ago and have bad health anxiety.
20507,Im still cramping off and on from the insertion but Im so scared of any of the hormonal side effects.
20508,Theres so many negative stories so Id appreciate any positive ones thank you.
20509,It works very well.
20510,I used to work in a obgyn office.
20511,Very few people have issues
20512,"I love mine, insertion sucked and I had random spotting and bloating for a few months after."
20513,By 6 months no more period and I havent had any noticeable hormonal changes.
20514,Worked a miracle for me!
20515,However I had mine put in under anaesthetic because I had to have polyp sample  taken to check for cancer.
20516,I have to change mine any day now
20517,Loved my mirena!
20518,Had one for 7 years and had a Skyla for 3 before that.
20519,Mirena actually lessened my period pain and flow.
20520,After about a year I stopped getting my period altogether.
20521,I would have had another one but Im planning to have kids soonish and opted for the pill.
20522,I am not going through another IUD insertion for only 12 years of protection  but will go back to Mirena when I need long term BC
20523,I also have health anxiety so I want to say good job for going through with the insertion!
20524,Youre already through the worst of it.
20525,The initial cramping sucks but it should get better soon.
20526,I never had any side effects from mine.
20527,I felt exactly the same physically and mentally after my second one was removed a few months ago.

20555,"If you had sex after ovulation, its unlikely to be a problem."
20556,"There is a small window after ovulation where you can still get pregnant, usually only up to 24 hours, but even then the chance is lower.As you said, ellaone is ineffective if you have already ovulated  but the biggest concern here is if you had sex and waited a few days to take the pill, as there is a bigger time frame in which you could ovulate."
20557,"If you took ellaone immediately, it will either mean 1."
20558,"You hadnt ovulated yet, in which case it would work2."
20559,You had ovulated and were in the small window after ovulation in which you can get pregnant 3.
20560,"You had already ovulated and were past the window, meaning elleone is ineffective but you can't get pregnant anywayEven if it was number 2, its still only around 30 chance of pregnancy (thats usually the higher number within a cycle depending on the exact time frame of ovulation, its usually lower after ovulation)."
20561,"So basically, although it is possible, I would say theres a reasonably low chance and you should try not to worry too much."
20562,"If you have PCOS, you are possibly used to having a delayed period and other symptoms anyway, but ellaone can cause many weird side effects including a delayed or missed period."
20563,"In addition, these extra hormones can affect your emotional state and sometimes increase anxiety which isn't fun when you are worrying about a possible pregnancy."
20564,Stressing can also delay your period even further.
20565,"Don't read too much into any hormonal symptoms you have over the next few weeks / even months, your hormones could take a while to settle and its completely normal for ellaone to cause them."
20566,"If your period is late (or even if it isn't but you are still worrying), take a test 2 weeks after sex and another one a week later to hopefully ease your mind."
20567,I usually find my period starts the day after taking a pregnancy test anyway
20568,thank you!
20569,"I also contacted the planned parenthood chat as per the bot in this thread, they were also super informative and reassuring."
20570,appreciate your help
20571,thank you so much.
20572,this was very helpful.
20573,"I took the pill about an hour after the incident, did not want to waste any time lol."
20574,at this time my period is technically about a day or so late but my period kind of shows up when it wants to as is.
20575,if nothing happens by next week I'll be sure to get some tests.
20576,"I appreciate your help and kindness, I've been so stressed T_T"
20577,Also I wanted to add onto the other comment regarding ovulation being difficult to track  its almost impossible to track it exactly without taking your temperature etc.
20578,"But if you have PCOS and irregular periods, its even harder to track!"
20579,So don't worry too much about when you think you ovulated
20580,"So I read the pill stops ovulation from occurring, but the time of month I'm supposed to ovulate I still get symptoms (increased discharge and sex drive, even cramps)."
20581,"I've been on the pill around six months and am overly paranoid about this  surely the pill is working given I'm taking it properly, right?"
20582,Is this normal?

20590,it came out negative this morning.
20591,this afternoon i started bleeding but its not my normal period bleeding where the first day i bleed a darkish red/brown but instead today it was bright red and almost pink.

20600,You dont get a period on those pills you get a withdrawal bleed during your inactive pills.
20601,Its normal for this to lighten or disappear over time.
20602,I always just test and retest for piece of mind LOL
20603,Seven days ago I had a Cooper IUD inserted under general anaesthetic.
20604,"After the first 24 hours the bleeding turned into spotting, but I took my last BC combination pill two days ago and now I have withdrawal bleeding that resembles a light/moderate period."
20605,"I have washable cotton pantyliners, which I've used for the spotting, but the bleeding I'm now getting is more than the pantyliners can handle."
20606,I'd normally use a menstrual cup but I've seen conflicting information on how long you can use one after getting an IUD inserted because of the risks of infection or expulsion.
20607,Some sources say 24 hours and others say a few weeks.Disposable pads give me a rash and I just find them extremely uncomfortable so I avoid using them as much as I can.
20608,Is it OK for me to use a menstrual cup now?
20609,What we need is large scale studies of IUD users and compare menstrual cup users vs. nonusers to determine if there is an increased risk of expulsion.
20610,We don't really have that yet.
20611,"This( review of the available literature found a ""possible"" connection, but high quality studies don't exist."
20612,"Anecdotally, there is a chance that if you don't break the seal correctly, it can suck the IUD out."
20613,"Alternatively, you can get the strings caught up with the cup and tug the device out of place."
20614,Some doctors recommend never using a cup while you have an IUD because of those risks.
20615,My GYN told me absolutely not to use the cup anymore.
20616,Im sorry no one told you but you shouldnt use a menstrual cup with an IUD.
20617,"Theres an increased risk of expulsion, just this month there have been two people on this sub who lost their IUD to a menstrual cup."
20618,My doctor told my specifically never to use them but unfortunately not every doctor does.
20619,I would recommend disposable pads or period underwear.
20620,Tampons you shouldnt use for at least a week because you run a higher risk of infection by introducing bacteria

20625,Try a menstrual disc instead!
20626,No suction and does about the same thing ) I personally find it easier to use as well
20627,"Thank you so much for the info, I'm glad I checked here before using my cup."
20628,I'm going to look for a different period product.
20629,"Oh no, I love my menstrual cup."
20630,"When I've looked online I've read that it's OK to use (as long as you break the suction before pulling it out) and no one told me any different, not even my doctor."
20631,Would a disc be any better?
20632,Discs dont suction so they are fine but you still shouldnt put anything up there for at least a week to lower your chances of infection
20633,Thank you!
20634,I'll buy some period underwear for now and in a few weeks I'll try a disc.
20635,I'm so glad I checked here first
20636,Hi there!
20637,I am 25 year old female who has only 2 sexual partners my whole life.
20638,"I have always been on birth control, starting at the age of 10 for bad periods and cramps."
20639,This last February (February 8th to be exact) I got the IUD of Kyleena.
20640,The sexual partner I had before I got this was only interested in oral and wasn't interested in a family or anything.
20641,"Fast forward to now, the person I am with, wants to eventually to have one."
20642,"My question is that since I have an IUD, If he cums inside me, could I get pregnant?"
20643,I am not that knowledgeable about sex as most of the stuff I've learned came from the internet.
20644,Tl/dr Boyfriend wants to cum inside me and I have an IUD.
20645,Will I get pregnant?
20646,Thank you for the answers!
20647,Please be kind!
20648,IUDs(or any bc) are effective and made assuming your partner is always cumming inside you

20660,If you expel an IUD its significantly more likely to happen again so nexplanon would be a safer bet
20661,so i was on the birth control pill for 3 years and abruptly got off it in November.
20662,"i loved the pill, had no problems with the pill."
20663,i decided to get off it as a result of something traumatic that happened and needed to maintain a period of celibacy.
20664,sooo i didnt see a point in continuing the hormones if i wasnt seeing anybody.
20665,"after i got off it, i gained weight FAST."
20666,and its been incredibly hard to shed any off.
20667,"i can barely eat, keep track of all my calories, and exorcise more than ever  but the scale wont budge."
20668,i gained about 20 lbs after stopping the pill and cant seem to lose any of it.
20669,"idk if its water, fat, or whatever the case may be."
20670,i just want it controlled.
20671,will getting back on the pill make a difference ?

20675,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
20676,Curious as to what pill it was?
20677,Same thing happened to me when I stopped in November of 2022 after 15 years.
20678,Gained 30 pounds since then and have horrible acne and some frontal balding patches.
20679,Working on getting it all under control now.
20680,Just had blood work done and my testosterone came back on the high end.
20681,"I am also extremely active ( CrossFit, strength training, walking every day ) and eat extremely well."
20682,I cannnnnnnot lose weight but I do not want to go back on BC
20683,"i was on the kyleena for 6 months and lost about 70lbs, but when i took it out i gained like 100lb lol"
20684,vienva 0.1 mg/0.02 mg
20685,"i personally have made peace with what happened last year, so im okay with getting back on BC if itll help with my weight issue."
20686,i definitely have not been happy with the way my body reacted after stopping it and its even more frustrating when every other solution doesnt seem to be helping.
20687,I get it!
20688,I am turning 30 and wanting to start a family in the next couple years so getting back on for me isnt an option right now unfortunately!
20689,It might be worth going to your dr and getting some hormone blood panels done though!
20690,Maybe get tested for PCOS
20691,Took First pill from new pack one hour late is it bad?
20692,If its a combination pill you have a 12 hour window to take it.
20693,And if its the mini pill you have a 3 hour window to take it before its considered late.
20694,Was only an hour late.

20710,The pill is effective immediately since you started on the first day of your period
20711,not my post BUT does this mean like.
20712,i could take it and then immediately have unprotected sex and be fine .. i didnt ask my doctor enough questions
20713,"Yes, if you start on your period"
20714,I'm a guy and I'm honestly not very knowledgeable about how this type of contraception works.
20715,So my ex girlfriend was on a contraceptive injection that she used to get on the same day every month.
20716,"I don't know what kind unfortunately, I just know it was hormone based and it went on the buttock."
20717,"She used to get a shot on the 10th of every month, the last time we had sex without protection was around the last days of August and then we split up not long after that, haven't had any further contact since things went a bit harshly."
20718,"My question is, in the case she didn't get the shot today (idk and I don't want to hit her up to ask her that, lol), I've read about sperm cells remaining alive for very very long, so how long does it take for this kind of method until its effects wear off?"
20719,Can the sperm cells outlive it?
20720,Is there any kind of real concern in this situation?
20721,"It might be a very stupid question, so thank you for bearing with me!"
20722,An answer would just be nice for my peace of mind.
20723,"Well she was still protected, and the sperm that would have been in her would have died by now, so even if she were to not take a shot behind your back it wouldnt do anything other than her stopping her shot."
20724,"Sperm lives for about five days in the fallopian tubes, and thats if it even gets there because many birth controls also thicken cervical mucus, thats like a miniature traffic jam."
20725,Do you mean every three months?
20726,Depo is every three months.
20727,Sperm live for around 5 days.
20728,We usually give a 7 day window in case you have superman sperm or whatnot.
20729,I'm assuming you're worried that if she misses her next dose that it could result in pregnancy?

20764,i was less than 80 pounds bc i had to watch what i eat for half the month to not have terrible pms cramps.. (so much more too) so now i dont have my period ive gained over 10 pounds and happy but ive realized its prolly not that healthy....
20765,"based on what your doc recommended, it seems like skipping periods to manage pain has worked for you so far."
20766,"but keep in mind, it might not be a longterm solution."
20767,"the weight gain you've mentioned could be linked to hormonal changes caused by saiid method, but it's tough to say for sure."

20785,"otherwise, i take mine continuously also."
20786,I did this as well.
20787,But I didnt skip the white pills.
20788,Just the brown.
20789,Ask the group for physicians!
20790,You should definitely get evaluated by a specialist for your periods.
20791,"Periods that painful arent normal you might have something going on, like endometriosis."
20792,I had it for years and it sucked.
20793,I went to Jacksonville Center for Reproductive Medicine and they were fantastic and did a great job.
20794,i was serverly underweight because i could barely ever eat anything because i wild throw it up from the pain of whatever undiagnosed disorder i have (i believe i do because thats just now normal) now since the problem doesnt exist anymore (bc i dont get any periods aka no pain) i can eat normally so i gained back normal weight ) i have 0 side effects and never did for some reason besides being able to eat.
20795,This is why I can't wait to get started on Lolo again!
20796,I had no idea how nice it was to not have a period.
20797,Just being able to wear what I want and not worry about bleeding everywhere is so freeing and saves money on products too which is great )
20798,"The weight gain is clearly from having your appetite back, not the hormones."
20799,I think it sounds like youre doing much better using the pill to skip your period than you were getting your period and being extremely ill from it.
20800,"There is no health reason why anyone needs to have a period, you are perfectly safe to keep skipping it with the pill."
20801,"but, really mate, the fact that you don't know the underlying cause of your condition is srsly concerning."
20802,"it's totally okay to skip periods under a doctor's advice, but also wise to understand the root cause of your issue."
20803,"no harm in seeking a second opinion, it could even help understand your condition better."
20804,"try to consult a gynecologist, maybe even a gastroenterologist, to rule out any possible digestive issues."
20805,"So, basically.."
20806,I switched my patch to the final one out of the pack last Sunday and on Monday I started spotting a pinkish color.
20807,"There was never enough to really fill a pad or even really stain one, but as the weak progressed the color then varied from pink to red to brown."
20808,Along with this Ive noticed what looks to be discharge mixed in there as well.
20809,"As I mentioned in the title, I use BC patches (Twirla), and so Ive had unprotected sex on multiple occasions without a second thought."
20810,"Ive spotted on multiple occasions exactly a week before my patch free week, but this time the appearance and flow was a bit different, which scared me and sent me on a spiral down google."

20838,So i got my IUD inserted In July of this year and ive already had my first period post insertion.
20839,However this month ive just been spotting for the past week and on my period tracker app it says im 11 days late for my period.
20840,I tested on the 6th day that i was late and it was negative.
20841,To be fair ive been under quite a bit of stress this past month and i also got sick.
20842,But is it normal for my period to be this late?

20846,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
20847,Okay so I got an iud (first form of birthcontrol ever) and it was a rough insertion.
20848,My period is late bc I was so stressed and my provider had to reposition the cervix holder 3 times.
20849,She also struggled to get past the second entrance of the cervix and had to force it in (20 mins of trying).
20850,"I had insane cramps for the last two days (got it friday, its now Sunday morning)."
20851,No one told me not to take baths so I did bc it helped with the pain.
20852,"I now have a low grade fever  starting late last night (never above 100.5), currently 99.6 with ibuprofen."
20853,What should I do?
20854,Part of me wants to get it out bc its been so hellsih so far.

20859,"I would go to the doctor, taking a bath increases your risk for infection or expulsion"
20860,Im a 24F and I have been with my 26M boyfriend for 4 years.
20861,We are pretty sure we dont want kids.
20862,Ive never been on birth control.
20863,Ive been trying so hard to convince him to get a vasectomy because I am terrified of all the birth control side effects I read about.
20864,I read so much more negative things about them than positive.
20865,"I am not diagnosed with anxiety but Ive dealt with it for majority of my life, especially healthrelated anxiety."
20866,I know starting any birth control will heighten my anxiety.
20867,I am more interested in holistic approaches.
20868,I worry I might have an allergic reaction to vitamins when I try a new one.
20869,All of it is just super overwhelming and hard for me to figure out.The only birth control options that I am considering are the pill or nuvaring.
20870,Im confused on why they dont prescribe a pill based off of your current hormone levels.
20871,"Im terrified of developing hormonal acne, vaginal dryness, gaining weight and all emotional effects it may have on me."
20872,Im pretty much at my max weight and will become so depressed if I gain more.
20873,I already workout 45 days a week.
20874,Im scared of changing the naturalness my body has known so long.
20875,But I wont know until I try.
20876,Im just terrified to try.
20877,"In a perfect world, BC would be beneficial to me and actually help me."
20878,"It might be if I knew where my hormones were at, what pill to take and if I should have more estrogen."
20879,I go back and forth between my feelings towards it.
20880,How anything I might go through on BC is worth not being pregnant.
20881,But then all the what ifs and worries come back and it puts me off from trying.
20882,I dont even know what outcome Im looking for writing this.
20883,Any advice helps.
20884,Knowing where your hormones are at doesnt really give any insight as to what pill will be best for you.
20885,Its often a bit of trial and error to find what works best for you as an individual.
20886,What are your partners thoughts on having a vasectomy?
20887,What are your thoughts on having your tubes removed (bilateral salpingectomy)?
20888,"I wish there were more options for men to take responsibility for birth control, but condoms might be your only option if youre against any birth control."
20889,"A vasectomy is not a good option unless he feels 100 certain that he absolutely never wants kids, and it would be totally reasonable if he doesnt feel that way at 26."
20890,"Most people have positive or neutral birth control experiences, but they dont write about it online."
20891,"Except for some crazy freak side effect Ive never heard of, 99.9 of birth control side effects are temporary and go away shortly after you get off of it."
20892,Im in the same boat at you.
20893,Im 24F  my 22M bf have been together for 14 months  Ive been terrified of being on birth control.
20894,I just started a month ago  the anxiety it has given has been awful  I also dont wanna have kids right now at all.
20895,How has your situation been?
20896,Weve been relying fully on condoms but I have had a couple scares.
20897,So I didnt want to start birth control but I hate this anxiety it gives me.
20898,Would you be open to getting sterilized yourself?
20899,"I had it done last year and it was an amazing decision, I wish I had done it sooner."
20900,There are so many resources in /r/childfree and /r/sterilization for anything you might be worried about )
20901,Marvelon isnt associated with weight gain and actually helped my anxiety.
20902,"YMMV of course, but discuss these concerns with a doctor if you decide to try it."
20903,The pill has been great for me.
20904,"I was super nervous too because of the horrible side effects I'd read about, but I honestly didn't have any other than some spotting when I first started."
20905,"I love skipping my periods, have clearer skin, nothing negative to speak of!"
20906,"First, i would recommend getting a consultation with a doctor for your boyfriend so he can understand exactly how simple of a procedure it is."
20907,Find some YouTube videos of people who documented their process and healing time.
20908,This is truly the best option if hes willing to do it.
20909,"I know the IUD is one of the more terrifying options, but its been the best for me, and I was VERY scared to get it."
20910,I only cried after it was inserted because of how RELIEVED I was that it was just uncomfortable instead of excruciatingly painful.
20911,"If you go right around your period, the cervix is open and insertion is less uncomfortable."
20912,I went with Kyleena as its smaller than Mirena and it fit just right.
20913,"Ive had no physical side effects aside from the cramps, bloating and spotting for the first few months."
20914,Ive gained a little weight but thats due to inactivity from some other unrelated health concerns.I have bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety and the IUD has not worsened any of those things.
20915,It has even helped because Im not experiencing the insane cramp pain which would really put me in a dark place during my period.I have worryfree intimacy which is super nice because I can really be in the moment.I know there are a ton of horror stories of IUDs but please dont think that this is EVERYONES experience.
20916,People are more prone to go out of their way to review something they had a bad experience with than they are to review something they liked.
20917,Youre always going to find horror stories if youre looking for them.
20918,I know how you feel though.
20919,I researched BC so hard that I basically felt like a pharmacist after lol.
20920,The truth is that most will come with some sort of side effect and unfortunately its all trial and error.
20921,"But when you find the right option, the pros will hopefully outweigh the cons and your mind will be at ease knowing that youre protected."
20922,"Im on the pill and have a dealt some negative side effects, but generally its majorly improved my quality of life and makes me feel better to know I wont get pregnant."
20923,"Ive been on two different types of pills, and I wont sugar coat it, the first month is usually the worst, but really its mostly mood wise."
20924,"Majority of the time its just gonna be mood wise, which it goes away after three months time."
20925,Some it goes away after a month and some more than that.
20926,"But it all depends on bodily makeup.For me the only side effects Ive had was occasionally having hot flashes and occasionally a little emotional, but they were far apart to the point where it never affected me.Its medication, there is trial and error and most of the time people are gonna flock online and shit on anything than give any positive feedback."
20927,Hell my pill I think has like a 1star or 2star rating but it works well for me and I have no issues.
20928,So relying on things like that especially with medication isnt the best way to go about it.
20929,I understand.
20930,"I have anxiety and honestly, pregnancy scared me more than taking a pill every day."
20931,I suggest finding a dr or obgyn that you're comfortable with and go over all your concerns.
20932,"Recently, I saw a few videos about TSS (toxic shock syndrome) and wondered how common or rare it was."
20933,Made a dr appointment and my dr said it was super rare and in her 26 years as a dr she's never seen it.
20934,She did my sterilization surgery a few years ago and I trust her.
20935,I was a little hesitant to go back on bc pills because of possible side effects.
20936,But she assured me it was fine since I had a previous history of no major side effects all the years I was on it.
20937,I decided to go back in it to skip periods so I can avoid periods and also tampons.
20938,I'm in a very low estrogen pill.
20939,But I personally get reassurance from my Dr's not just what I see on the internet.
20940,Trust your gut.
20941,My anxiety is usually calmed by professionals reassuring me.
20942,What calms your anxiety?
20943,Have you done research on the different types of contraceptives?
20944,Have you tried spermicide?
20945,I used to combine the pill and spermicide films called vcf (vaginal contraceptive films)  that combination worked great for me for awhile until I was sterilized.
20946,"But like some other people have said, birth control is a trial and error thing."
20947,What works great for some people may not work for you.
20948,Everyone's body chemistry is different.
20949,Been on it for almost a year n I was also terrified of effects of it.
20950,Im currently on the patch but will be off of it next month since I no longer have insurance.
20951,Its different for everyone some people have strong side affects some dont you dont know until youre on it.
20952,What affected me most was the nausea when I first started but greatly improved my period pain plus no longer have bad acne.
20953,Hey!
20954,Ive been on birth control for the past 6 years.
20955,My first birth control was great but had to get off of it because my insurance stopped covering it and it wouldve been 300 a month out of pocket.
20956,"When I first started it, I was extremely hormonal the first few months and had headaches almost every day but it went away over time."
20957,I was on that for about 5 and a half years.
20958,I recently had to switch over to a diff birth control which sucked!
20959,I was bleeding everyday for the past 3 months and had terrible cramps/mood swings.
20960,Ive realized over time that my anxiety has worsened since getting on BC so Ive decided to give my body a break and get off of it just a few days ago.
20961,"Its terrifying bc Ive never been off of it and Im paranoid about pregnancy but I feel like for my health, its best to stop."
20962,"Everyone has different experiences and sadly, its all experimental."
20963,You might find the right one within time or you might find the right one instantly.
20964,"Personally, Im glad I was on it as it protected me but now Im starting to wonder what its done to my body health wise as theres a lot of negative side effects that Ive experienced over the years that I didnt even think couldve been my birth control but am now starting to realize it started after using it."
20965,"If youre debating and going back and forth, I definitely wouldnt do any sterilization as its a permanent solution."
20966,I would either stick to condoms or get on birth control if you dont mind experimenting and possibly having bad side effects.
20967,Im still very iffy about birth control because I love that it protects so well but hate how its not completely natural and does have side effects depending on the person.
20968,A good non hormonal option would be the copper IUD but Ive also heard iffy things about the IUD.
20969,Sorry for the ramble!
20970,Just wanted to give you some insight.
20971,Good luck and I hope you find something that works for you
20972,Im on slynd and all Ive had was 10 lbs weight gain and one month of 1 extra period.
20973,"It actually made me feel so much better bc I had crazy amounts of pain for my periods before, and thats gone."
20974,Just hoping to alleviate your fears to a degree.
20975,I feel like more people post that have issues than the ones who dont.
20976,You can also try a new pill if one doesnt work for you.
20977,Nothing is permanent.
20978,"I feel like in general, people who have horror stories are going to go online and share those to a much greater degree than people who have had perfectly ordinary/boring experiences with birth control."
20979,"It may help to keep in mind that these are, by and large, the outliers."
20980,"I will share that my husband had a vasectomy years ago, and his experience was fairly easy."
20981,He had a quick recovery time and really no side effects afterwards.
20982,The biggest hurdle for him was finding a doctor who would do it in the first place because he was still in his 20s and didnt have children.
20983,"I will also share that I continue to use a Mirena IUD and just got mine replaced, even though I dont really need it in combination with his vasectomy."
20984,"Ive really enjoyed not dealing with the pain, mess and inconvenience of a monthly period."
20985,"Even though insertion hurt, that was a onetime deal and in my experience, not worse than a monthly period."
20986,"Some doctors are also getting better about offering pain management for it, too."
20987,I have some health anxiety so I get it but the pill isnt bad.
20988,I was on it for 15 years.
20989,Ive tried a couple but stuck with Yaz.
20990,I will say that it gave me fatigue/low energy and I did gain weight but a hormonal imbalance from too much hiit/over exercising made me gain more weight than the pill.
20991,I just got off of it recently (just got married) and its been a month and I can tell Im regulating naturally already.
20992,I would speak with your doctor about your concerns.
20993,There are different levels of hormones in different pills so some will affect you less than others.
20994,"Also, I highly recommend talking to a therapist about your health anxiety if you arent already."
20995,"If you are wanting nonhormonal options, there is always the copper IUD!"
20996,It usually causes heavier periods but totally hormone free
20997,"Ive been on combo pills (I got a PE while taking it but did have cancer at the time so not sure if its the BC fault), POP, used only condoms, pull out method (I now have a 2.5 year old lol), and now an IUD."
20998,Out of them I felt the least side effects from the POP and IUD.
20999,I feel like my libido and vaginal dryness improved a ton after getting IUD rather than taking a pill.
21000,I also gained a ton of weight while on POP but I did start taking lexapro at the same time which I think is responsible more than anything.
21001,Just try a pill or nuvaring.
21002,"Like you just said, you wont know until you try."
21003,"Many women have no side effects from BC, you might be one of them!"
21004,Its not a depo shot or an IUD so you can literally stop at anytime if need be.
21005,Most of the woman dont experience any negative side effects on a pill.
21006,Get a tubal!
21007,Welcome and please flair your post if not currently flaired.
21008,Questions?
21009,"First read the Mistake or Pregnancy Risk sticky( or the Consolidated Experience post( If this is an experience post please consider adding it to the listPlanned Parenthood online chat(The rules and additional resources can be found on the About / Sidepage (desktop users look to the right and Reddit app up top).I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."
21010,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
21011,I think that it isnt fair that he expects you to take a drug you dont want to take in an effort to avoid a really simple outpatient surgical procedure.
21012,"Getting your tubes tied is also way, way, way more invasive."
21013,"I do encourage you to question if you want to be with someone who is this selfish?You could try a non hormonal method, like the copper IUD?"
21014,And you can just continue using condoms!
21015,There is nothing wrong with condoms when properly used.
21016,I have chronic severe anxiety as well and was terrified of birth control but desperate to stop my periods.
21017,I was so sure it was gonna be awful.
21018,Theres also the fact that people are WAY more likely to talk about something private like bc when theyve had an issue.
21019,"Just like how people are more likely to leave a bad review than a good one for restaurants and such.But guess what, its been great."
21020,Ive realized I for sure had PMDD and my natural cycle was making my anxiety worse.
21021,I feel so much better not having that monthly spike in anxiety and awful periods.
21022,I also dont get any side effects.
21023,My advice is to TREAT YOUR ANXIETY.
21024,Get u sum meds and therapy.
21025,SSRIs dont work for me but Im on buspar and a betablocker and that shit helps so much.
21026,"And give bc a try, but with methods you can easily stop."
21027,"Just try it, try not to be hypervigilant about your body and mind, and see what happens."
21028,"Maybe use an app to track your moods etc so you can notice patterns or lack thereof.Also theres tons of different hormones and formulas, so if one bc doesnt work great for you you can try another."
21029,"Also, just a note, it is unreasonable to ask someone who is 26 years old and presumably has no kids to permanently sterilize themselves."
21030,You are kinda foisting your anxiety off onto your boyfriend here.
21031,"Even if bc doesnt work out for you, condoms  pullout will suffice."
21032,But no one needs to be pressuring someone else to get sterilized here.
21033,The reason I say that is because I was prescribed loryna which helps treat hormonal acne and seen a lot of girls say they had clear skin before taking it which leads me to believe it does matter how much/which hormones youre putting into your body.
21034,I assumed it went hand in hand but maybe it doesnt.
21035,He has said in the past he would do it but now he says he doesnt want to get his balls cut.
21036,I think he sees it as a big surgery.
21037,Ive only heard how simple of a procedure it is and recovery isnt super bad.
21038,Ive tried to warn him of all the potential side effects I could go through but its like it doesnt resonate.
21039,I havent looked into tubal ligation because it actually is a serious surgery which Im not ready for.
21040,I also know a lot of doctors wont/dont do it before youve had any kids.
21041,"Yeah I gained some weight when I got on birth control (510lbs) and my periods can come with migraines, heavy cramps, low appetite, and/or fatigue."
21042,"That being said, birth control makes my periods 100 predictable timewise because I'm on the pill (Sunday  Wednesday, once a month) which I really appreciate lol no more bleeding through undies or shorts due to an unexpected period."
21043,Plus my partner is able to predict my mood leading up to it and I forewarn him ahead of time because I can get really crabby and he's super forgiving of it because he's wonderful.
21044,"However, I know it differs person to person, even on the pill."
21045,My sister was on birth control and didn't have periods at all.
21046,"My fiance and I don't want kids, so I felt comfortable with me being on birth control, and we use condoms every time."
21047,"He is planning to get a vasectomy at some point, but that is something he's decided on his own, simply because he's known for years that he doesn't want kids."
21048,It is hard to say if were going to stick with not wanting kids.
21049,Its been back and forth for me lately.
21050,Thats why I have been contemplating starting birth control.
21051,Coming off of birth control was another thing I was fearing.
21052,Thank you for your response!
21053,Ive mainly used fertility awareness (tracking ovulation) and failed after the first 3 years then again a year later.
21054,I could have prevented it the second time but didnt take it as serious as I should have.
21055,We use pullout method but its risky and I dont want to go through what I went through again to put simply.
21056,Ive used condoms and VCF strips as well.
21057,You can only get pregnant 5 days before ovulation and during it.
21058,Sperm can live inside the vagina for up to 5 days thats why women end up getting pregnant.
21059,So unless youre ovulating or about to and there isnt sperm inside you I wouldnt worry.
21060,At least I wouldnt worry.
21061,I would track my fertility again but at this point I need something also preventing it in case an accident.
21062,What BC did you start?
21063,"Thank you, I will start researching into that more."
21064,Thank you for your help!
21065,Im glad the IUD worked for you.
21066,I might consider it again.
21067,Thats good to know!
21068,Thank you
21069,This is so true about the negative bias.
21070,I used copper IUD in my younger years and loved it!
21071,And I never came on any forums to write about it.
21072,I also used FAM with basal temp and it was great and I never posted about it.
21073,I had a positive Mirena insertion and positive run with it and never posted.
21074,Only started searching forums lately once I needed something new.
21075,Im sure online posting patterns tend to be biased towards people who arent happy with what theyre using.
21076,"I now sometimes comment about the positives of other things Ive used, but Im only here in the first place because I needed a change!"
21077,Thank you for your response!
21078,Youre sweet  Ive heard a lot of the same stories.
21079,I dont want any permanent problems to come from birth control.
21080,"Its a scary thing, especially the increased risk of blood clots and strokes when you start it."
21081,So many other health risks too.
21082,"The one I was prescribed has 11,000 lawsuits against them for health related reasons."
21083,I was wanting a copper IUD for awhile but the insertion stories terrified me.
21084,The risk of it getting embedded and copper poisoning were also huge red flags for me as well.
21085,It sucks that we dont have safer and easier ways to prevent pregnancy.
21086,I would say in most cases the benefits outweigh the negative side effects.
21087,Its a matter of weighing out the two for each person.
21088,Thats not true unfortunately.
21089,More woman have side effects than dont and just dont realize it until theyre off of it.
21090,She stated shes unsure of whether or not she wants kids.
21091,Tubal is permanent unless you get it reversed which doesnt always work unfortunately ) I wish we had safer options.
21092,"I was sterilized at 24 years old, never pregnant, no spouse or otherwise serious relationship."
21093,I found the doctor who approved me through r/childfree.
21094,"It was the right decision for me, but I completely understand it not being the right decision for everyone."
21095,All hormonal methods will impact users differently.
21096,Unfortunately there are not methods available to minimize the trial and error process at this time.
21097,"Tubal ligations are outdated, bisalps are far more effective and from what Ive read on here not hard to recover from."
21098,"Finding a doctor willing to do it is the challenge, especially if you arent in a country that resource list covers."
21099,Its a bigger decision than people think.
21100,We looked into it too.
21101,Its not as reversible as media can make us believe.
21102,Can I ask what FAM method you were using when it failed?
21103,I'm curious!
21104,Of course!!
21105,And yes omg.
21106,My blood pressure raised from using birth control and I was terrified Id get clots or have a stroke.
21107,"Lately, every time I took my BC I would have anxiety knowing I was putting something into my body that could possibly kill me."
21108,It started to weigh heavy on my mind and I decided its not worth the risk even though I love knowing Im fully protected.
21109,"I wish there were better options as well, its so frustrating  the iud scared me too with all of the insertion stories so I decided against it."
21110,"Also, condoms are uncomfortable for me so Im not looking forward to that either."
21111,It sucks so much but I am excited to see what its like to be off of hormones for the first time in 6 years.
21112,Ive been on it since I was around 15 so Im hoping I see a difference in my mood/anxiety.
21113,"If youre worried about issues like blood clots and high bp, most progesteroneonly options would be fine."
21114,"Depo, at least according to my doctor, could possibly raise bp (I think due to weight gain?)"
21115,"and with my anxiety already being bad, I have to get it closely monitored with each dose of Depo I get, and minus weight gain depo has been lifechanging for me, which is funny because it seems like everyone wants to demonize it."
21116,"Im on calcium and Vit D to reduce the effects of possible bone density loss, and I get that both of these side effects sound severe, but I feel better than I have ever felt."
21117,"HBC is so trial and error, and the majority of side effects go away within months after you stop taking it."
21118,"I got blood tests done, wondered if I had a burnout, but no one could find out what was causing my extreme fatigue and concentration problems."
21119,Stopped taking the pill and it was gone.
21120,"Sadly side effects can be discredited, and so many people don't connect the weird health problems to hormones."
21121,"My other experiences, other combo pill and Implanon, were better, but then we are talking about experiencing emotions flatter and developing an eating disorder (luckily my extreme nausea is mostly gone now, but I just struggle with appetite still)."
21122,Weight loss on birth control also isn't talked about a lot.
21123,There needs to be more attention about it tbh.
21124,"Birth control can be great, and often the positives outweighs the negatives."
21125,"I wouldn't be able to finish my education without it (cramps were too painful, even with pain killers) and I would be constantly dizzy (iron defiency), so I am definitely thankful it exists."
21126,And it prevents a lot of unwanted pregnancies.
21127,But all things have side effects and I totally see why people aren't comfortable with them.
21128,"OP, you can go to a doctor or gyno to see what you're comfortable with."
21129,Pullout  condoms can also be used.
21130,Or fertility awareness methods with tracking.
21131,Both don't have side effects really
21132,Unless youre a doctor or have research paper receipts I dont think you have any right to claim that
21133,Thank you for your help!
21134,"I mean that is true, as the years go on vasectomies have a lower chance of being reversible and they are even more expensive than the vasectomy themselves."
21135,"I don't really think it's a good idea either to say it is without knowing that, some men are different and they work even years down the line while others will still shoot blanks and won't be able to have a kid."
21136,It's a draw of the cards.Edit to say I'm not sure why you're being downvoted for saying that
21137,I have regular periods so I used the calendar and cervical mucus method.
21138,I use a tracking app called life and it shows you the days youre fertile and ovulating.
21139,It was all human error that it failed if anything.
21140,I stand by FAM honestly.
21141,I was just kind of careless with it because it worked for so long but unfortunately learned the hard way and now Im paranoid.
21142,I know a lot of women track with basal body temperature so that is probably a more effective way for sure.
21143,Im glad to hear someone else relates to me!
21144,It annoys me so much when people say wear condoms or stay abstinent as if I havent thought about those options before and how unrealistic it is to do either of those forever.
21145,Im happy for you for getting off BC.
21146,Im sure your body will thank you!!!
21147,A lot of my friends have stopped it too after taking it for years which makes it harder for me to want to start.
21148,This is a really weird comment to discredit women's trials and tribulations with BC.
21149,"The medical industry is famously opposed to taking women and their complaints seriously, and I absolutely believe BC has side effects for EVERYONE whether it's minor or major."
21150,"There is a lot of bias when it comes to reporting about it since women are never taken seriously, side effects aren't seen as a big deal since the ""pros outweigh the cons,"" and because again, there is very little research or dedication to women's studies ESPECIALLY about women's hormones and hormonal cycles."
21151,I'm not saying that BC is terrible  I have an IUD myself and personally have had very positive experiences.
21152,"However, it's super disingenuous to act like BC is the end all save all that's perfect 99999.999 of the time."
21153,Literally every woman I know has had at least one awful experience with BC.
21154,I was also sterilized at 26 with no kids
21155,Yeah idk either if you spend 2 minutes googling it you can see the statistics and how drs warn you it may not be reversible.
21156,Its a big decision for men to make.
21157,F me for caring about mens health and mental wellbeing I guess?
21158,"Oof, yeah calendar is always just a best guess, unfortunately stuff like that gives FAM a bad rep. My ovulation tracker is as much as a week off my actual ovulation and my cycle is regular af  I know there are some mucusonly FAM methods but they're difficult and hard to use because you can see the same/similar types of discharge multiple times throughout your cycle."
21159,Basal body temp  cervical position and mucus is supposed to be the most effective afaik.
21160,If you wanted you could learn an actual method like Sensiplan or Taking Charge of Your Fertility and add in some backup methods or barriers if you don't want to use hormonal bc.
21161,LITERALLY.
21162,Thank you.
21163,Im not saying birth control is BAD.
21164,Ive been on it for 6 years.
21165,Ive just heard alot more bad stories than good and people are getting pissed at me bc Im not a doctor and cant claim that Lmfao.
21166,Im talking about MY personal experience with people telling me about their birth control stories.
21167,"Yes it is amazing for some people but for a lot, it can be challenging."
21168,What you believe isnt factually true just because the medical community has a habit of dismissing womens concerns.
21169,I also think the scientific research community is a shade different since theyre dedicated to getting unbiased accurate results.
21170,Yall are free to your own opinions but saying shit like mOrE wOmEn hAvE IsSuEs ThAN dOnT is very misleading in a time when we already have a crisis in womens health and the options available to us are limited.
21171,Scaring people away is a bad move.
21172,"Everything has the possibility of side effects, even Tylenol."
21173,"But we have the research behind it and laws to protect us from the worst outcomes in side effects, so making educated decisions is all thats needed."
21174,My period always starts on time but I would question if the length of my period was accurate on the app.
21175,I wouldnt be sure if my period had fully ended or not because I had 7 day periods for a long time then it went to 5.
21176,I also bleed heavy for 3 days then 2 days its very light but because my period was always on time I knew it worked.
21177,I looked into natural cycles but for some reason it overwhelms me because it seems complex.
21178,I have to really focus on learning it and Im sure Ill get the hang of it.
21179,Im definitely interested in it!
21180,"Then keep it about you, dont make large scale claims about how it effects random women you dont know."
21181,Natural cycles is calendar method with a subscription fee  It uses past cycle data to predict safe days and occasionally turns green to red days retroactively.
21182,"Also, temp itself can change with sleep, alcohol, and illness as well so by itself it's not an infallible indicator, that's why the most effective FAMs have that secondary check paired with it."
21183,I briefly looked into NC myself.
21184,There really isn't an app shortcut that will do all the work for you.
21185,It might be helpful to use alongside secondary checks if you wanted to pay for it but I wouldn't take its predictions as gospel unfortunately
21186,Well then I will actually look into the methods you mentioned!
21187,Lol
21188,Join us over at r/FAMnNFP for more accurate bc methods
21189,Thank you!
21190,"I only have one question.so today I  F18 started taking hormonal bc, and now I am scared that I will lose feelings for my bf because of them."
21191,Can that really happen if u really like ur boyfriend!
21192,"No, birth control does not change who youre attracted to."
21193,Its a common myth based on a highly flawed study (see here( for a more complete explanation)
21194,Hey I took birth control for the first time in august for only 5 days and stopped after the constant anxiety over nothing.
21195,I had anxiety before the pills but it made it so much worse.
21196,It started making me feel as if I wasnt loving my boyfriend enough since I would feel either anxious or numb most of the day and I would get emotional because I thought the pills made me not love him anymore and it would give me these intrusive thoughts like making me feel guilty for interacting with other guys my age and that I wanted to break up with him which made no sense because before the pills I wasnt feeling this way.
21197,"Then I realized it wasnt just with my boyfriend but with everyone and everything around me I loved, I just wasnt as happy and I started feeling suicidal ."
21198,Ive been off it for a month now but still sometimes feel numb and anxious but getting better with therapy the serotonin pills Ive been prescribed.
21199,I still dont feel 100 like my hyperactive self but should be back to normal in a about a few months since I stopped the pills way too quickly before letting my body get used to it but please If you ever start feeling a similar way I would advise you to stop it as well or switch your pill brand since every pill affect every woman differently.

21203,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
21204,This is based on studies about women and ovulation.
21205,"Basically, women during ovulation are more likely to like certain masculine features (e.g., beards)."
21206,"The idea is that if hormone cycles can affect what features you're attracted to, then getting on birth control, which pauses your cycle, can supposedly change what features you find attractive."
21207,"In the real world, attraction is very complex and has lots of facets to it."
21208,Starting or stopping ovulation isn't going to destroy a perfectly happy relationship.
21209,"You might find a story of someone who said that something changed negatively, but then you'll find 10 stories of people who found their sex life improved because they had less pregnancy anxiety and could be more spontaneous.Don't psych yourself out."
21210,I started a hormonal pill for about 1.5 years for endometriosis pain.
21211,"First couple months on it made my hormones go all over the place, crying for no reason, feeling easily irritable."
21212,Often I would cry to my bf to please forgive my behaviors because the pill was making my hormones roller coaster.
21213,"Boys generally dont understand what its like, so be prepared to feel emotional, and communicate to your bf what youre feeling."
21214,Educate him on how hormonal birth control pills may affect a woman so he can try to understand.
21215,"Personally, my hormones leveled out once my body became used to the pills and I felt SO much better."
21216,"No more endometriosis pain, few periods, and normal hormones.However, if I skipped a pill, then I felt an immediate change in my hormones."
21217,"I hated trying to remember to take my pills, so I switched to a hormonal IUD."
21218,"Again, no pain, no periods, no roller coaster hormones, no worries."
21219,Im good to keep it for 7 more years.
21220,"So for your new pills, expect to feel more emotional as your body adjusts to them."
21221,But you wont lose feelings.
21222,Thats but a myth.
21223,I dont think thats possible.
21224,But in my experience it affected my libido.
21225,Thank you
21226,Thank you!
21227,The more I read about bc the less scared I am )
21228,How did it effect ur libido?
21229,"And how do I know when I can start having sex with out condoms, I have friends that tell me they started 7 days after the first pill and other have told me to use condoms for 3 months after starting the pill"
21230,I've lost my sex drive.
21231,I don't feel really excited anymore haha You'll see that info on your bc's leaflet.
21232,"I'm on Yasmin and it states that after 7 days on the pill, you will be protected from pregnancy."
21233,I have followed that and didn't have any pregnancy scares so far.
21234,I've been using the pill for about a year now.
21235,"Ive been testing since 5 days after being ejaculated into, which was also my ovulation day according to my app of 3 years."
21236,"My obgyn said that my iud fell out of place, I was given a pregnancy test on the 8th (already took one before that but she did it again to be sure) and it was instantly negative."
21237,I took a few between then and today (12 dpo) and it was still negative.
21238,My period is expected in two days and Im still anxious about it not coming.
21239,Should I just wait it out?
21240,"Was my last test relevant enough or should I wait to test on my expected day, if I dont come on?"
21241,A test is fully accurate 21 days after sex so you cant be absolutely sure until then
21242,A test is accurate 2 weeks after sex and definitive after 3.
21243,Apps arent accurate at tracking ovulation so you need to test following that timeline.
21244,If your period doesnt come you can test and if thats negative then youre late because you ovulated later than you think

21270,"In which case, perhaps you can try and arrange the gynecologist appointments etc for a time when he is at work and explain its just a quick blood test?"
21271,"Otherwise, you can call the gynecologist before and go for an appointment to get birth control."
21272,"While there, you can explain the situation to them, and ask them what they think is a good option for your situation / if it will show up on the test."
21273,"They won't share that information with him, what you say will be confidential and they have possibly dealt with people in similar situations before."

21284,"!i dont think itll show up on a blood test that youre on birth control BUT it will show that your estrogen/progesterone hormones are elevated, which is what prevents you from getting pregnant."
21285,you will have to explain the situation to your doctor alone  tell them whats going on.this is a really fucked up situation.
21286,continue to take your birth control pills and you are eventually gonna have to tell your supposed husband something because hes gonna catch onto why youre not getting pregnant.
21287,tell him you were diagnosed with some hormonal issues or perhaps infertility.
21288,this does sound even more fucked up but you need to focus on protecting yourself from getting pregnant.

21296,hi folks!
21297,I started less than a week ago on desogestrel (combi pill i believe) and hadnt felt it was changing my mental health.
21298,"Me and my partner had some kind of disagreement, where he made a joke which i didnt understand that he was joking."
21299,I didnt get angry at him I just got confused.
21300,But he ended up telling me I should come off the pill cause its making me crazy essentially.
21301,I didnt think I was being crazy and I also couldnt imagine my mental health would be so affected in less than a week of taking it?
21302,I had been on it for around 45 days.
21303,The one im taking has less hormones too.
21304,"Birth control doesnt always affect your mental health, a lot of people dont notice any major mood changes while on it."
21305,"Thats a horribly insensitive thing for your partner to say and an overreaction from him, especially when you have only just started on the pill."
21306,"i had major mood swings and depression within a few days of starting it, lasted 3 months."
21307,i was honestly shocked my bf didnt leave me since we hadnt been together that long.
21308,i didnt even realize how insane i was being until i felt better
21309,I mean  it can be right away but honestly it sounds like your partner is gaslighting you?
21310,You dont feel that its affecting or changing your mental health.
21311,Therefore I doubt it is.
21312,Your partner just cant face up to the fact that he made a joke that wasnt funny and honestly him blaming your meds/you is kind of alarming.

21317,Following
21318,It is very true that when you start birth control you could feel all kinds of crazy or moody.
21319,Im going through the same thing right now!
21320,The good news is that everything is supposed to even out over time.
21321,In a few months you might feel a little better mentally.
21322,"But yes, birth control can affect so many things including your mood, mental health, and more."
21323,Good luck
21324,It could just be the new fluctuation in hormones.
21325,Not everyone experiences mental health changes.
21326,"Im currently taking Vienva and one of the biggest complaints is heightened depression/anxiety, Ive been on it for almost a year now and havent experienced anything like that!"
21327,"yeah I thought so as well, it all feels a bit misogynistic actually."
21328,How funny it is that Im the one supposedly overreacting!
21329,"Im definitely feeling more rational after reading these comments though, thank you."
21330,wow Im sorry your experience was like that!
21331,Ive had some issues in the past but there were definitely some other factors causing them too.
21332,Glad to hear it hasnt lasted for you and youre feeling better!
21333,"I was thinking this was the case, as Im acting quite normal."
21334,I usually misinterpret jokes a lot anyway so its not like this was even abnormal for me.
21335,Its got me kind of bummed but I dont feel like I wont be able to talk it through at least!
21336,Thank you!
21337,I generally feel fine though so I think this ones on him.
21338,I dont think this is your birth control.
21339,But I am concerned about your partners deflecting!
21340,A little too close to DARVO for comfort.
21341,"Remember you know yourself best, not finding a joke funny doesnt mean theres something wrong with you or even that you missed or misinterpreted something sometimes the person making the jokes isnt funny  that isnt your fault!"
21342,"I hadnt heard of DARVO before thank you for showing me this, Ive got quite a track history of being with this kind of person unfortunately so its important to understand the signs."
21343,I will definitely talk to him about it and see how he reacts.
21344,With a history I definitely feel more equipped to deal with this kind of thing.
21345,Thank you I definitely feel better about what Im thinking after your comments!
21346,Im rooting for you!
21347,Im sorry youve experienced a history with this type of behaviour!
21348,I have too.
21349,Its quite damaging.
21350,We arent alone )
21351,So I have been spotting for about 6 months straight and finally started BC to try and help regulate the bleeding.
21352,I am about 34 weeks in and the last few days I began to bleed really heavy.
21353,I am wondering since I haven't had a real period in so long that maybe my lining is just trying to thin out?
21354,Has this happened to anyone else?

21362,She is very aware.

21364,For sure!
21365,It is normal though and okay as long as its not worse!
21366,"Hi all, I had my paraguard IUD placed around 1 month ago."
21367,"I had relatively no issues until the beginning of September, where I began to notice some strange discomfort and cramping."
21368,"The cramps dont feel like they used to, without the IUD  they feel much deeper and more uncomfortable, but less painful."
21369,The best I can explain is like someones digging around and touching my cervix.
21370,"I might call the doctors as Im slightly worried about having pelvic inflammatory issues, considering it also hurts to pee at the moment and Im feeling a bit sick with the uncomfortable cramps."
21371,"Basically, my question is whether the changed sensation of cramps is normal."

21378,Are you able to feel your strings?
21379,Yeah.
21380,"I forgot to mention this in the post, sorry, but its still in place and I can feel the strings perfectly fine."
21381,Are you due for your period anytime soon?
21382,That could be why the cramps feel a bit more intense.
21383,Yeah I am.
21384,"I expected the cramps to get more intense but the feeling of them is so entirely different, thats what Im worried about."
21385,The cramping is normal leading up to your period and during.You've only had the IUD for a short time.
21386,Your body is still adjusting to it.
21387,Thanks for your help.
21388,Ultimately turned out I had a severe kidney infection.
21389,I was recently diagnosed with (unconfirmed  no laparoscopy) endometriosis.
21390,"In order to avoid surgery for the immediate future, we agreed to treat the endo with oral contraceptive  Diane 35."
21391,Ive been on two full packs and Ive recently started the third.
21392,"Ive been having some pretty hardcore symptoms  spotting, breaking out and Ive put on a little weight."
21393,Ive chalked the more unpleasant acne and spotting to my hormones adjusting to the oral contraceptive and I havent taken my 7 day break in between packs for the sake of trying to fast track levelling off my hormones.
21394,So my question is how long will this continue?
21395,Could this just be my reaction to Diane 35 or will the symptoms likely to stop?
21396,Im suffering
21397,Spotting is very common especially when you skip the placebos.
21398,Personally my body didnt let me skip them without bad spotting.
21399,Skipping them is perfectly fine but it wont fast track you adjusting.

21405,"Im not entirely sure, I was put on Yasmin (I know not Diane, but sharing my experience) for similar reasons (suspected endometriosis and painful cramps) however I got really bad hormonal acne along my jawline which I had never experienced before."
21406,I got thru two and a bit pill packs (consecutively like you) before deciding to give up (as recommended by my GP) but that was more so because of my other side effects from the pill (crying everyday and panic attacks).
21407,"I heard that a few breakouts are fine and will likely go away, and everybody is different."
21408,But mine was only continually getting worse and my doc said that it would unlikely change much by the three month mark which is recommended time length to test a BC!
21409,Id say just do what youre comfortable with and determine how much these side effects are affecting you.
21410,I only stopped the pill a few weeks ago and my skin is only just settling a bit now but I feel a lot better mentally which was my main concern and Im planning on trying the Mirena IUD once my hormones regulate.
21411,I hope your symptoms subside and it works for you ) because when I was looking online I did see a lot of success stories for Diane and Yasmin !
21412,Thank you so much!
21413,Hi all!Ive been on LoestrinFe for the past almost 8 months and Ive been spotting for more than half of that duration.
21414,Initially I thoughtit was breakthrough bleedingand my body adjusting to the medicationbut I still get spotting every month.
21415,"I spot for typically more than 3 days at a time, and its just an inconvenience.Anyone have the same experience?"
21416,Ive read some of threads where people also experienced spotting outside of the breakthrough period.
21417,If this continues I will most definitely go see my OBGYN.
21418,Thank you in advance!

21423,"I'm on depo, and sometimes my tokophobia flares up."
21424,But I just want to hear positive reviews on how bc has prevented pregnancies with you!
21425,"I'm using depo, and withdrawel so it must be 99,98 effective."
21426,"Which is 0,02 risk over the course of the year."
21427,Am I safe?
21428,And please share your stories.
21429,Been on the pill for almost 10 years.
21430,Sometimes used condoms and withdrawal with it and sometimes didnt.
21431,Never been pregnant!
21432,"Been with my bf for a year, have had a lot of different kinds of sex where semen could get in and around my lady bits."
21433,"Was on the implant, now on the pill."
21434,Still not pregnant.
21435,My bf was with his ex for two years and they just used the pill and she never got pregnant during their relationship!
21436,But!
21437,"I get your fear, I have it too!"
21438,Always an option to have your partner wear a condom for peace of mind!
21439,"Two types of BC is always more effective than one (when used properly)!No birth control except abstinence is 100 effective, but you are very, very probably protected!"
21440,Perfect use of Depo is very safe!
21441,")Edit to add A long time ago, as a teen, I mentioned something about sex  pregnant!"
21442,from my very unfortunate abstinence only education in school.
21443,"To which my dad replied, ""If sex always resulted in pregnancy, we'd be buried in babies."""
21444,"So, to put things in perspective, of all the women on birth control using it properly, if it didn't work, we'd being seeing a lot more babies than we are."
21445,That helped my mindset a lot!
21446,D
21447,"I've been on the pill for 5 years, relied on it as my only contraceptive many times, so far 0 pregnancy scares and 0 side effects."
21448,"I'm 34, used contraception since 17."
21449,"Pill, then condoms, pill again, vaginal ring and currently I have a copper IUD."
21450,Never had a pregnancy or pregnancy scare!
21451,I never really had a pregnancy scare after 10 years of being on the pill.
21452,"I was really good at taking it, I only missed a pill maybe five times over the years."
21453,Anyway I reeeeally love letting a guy finish inside.
21454,I never did one night stands it was always long term bfs.
21455,Anyway!
21456,No pregnancy scares for 10 whole years!
21457,I eventually started using pregnancy test strips every week this past year.
21458,I had started taking Slynd and it made my periods very irregular.
21459,"I had hormonal IUDs for 10 years, and never used withdrawal with it."
21460,Worked so well I figured I must just be infertile.
21461,"When my husband and I wanted to get pregnant, I had my IUD removed and was pregnant within 6 weeks."
21462,So clearly the IUDs worked!
21463,"I don't plan on having more kids, and I didn't hesitate to get another IUD at my 6 week appointment!"
21464,"ive been on the shot for over a year, i have sex with my partner twice a day (usually) we never use condoms or withdrawal, just my depo shot."
21465,"never been pregnant or had a scare, but i definitely understand the anxiety and i take a test every few weeks usually lol"
21466,Been on and off the pill since I was 17.
21467,"Dont usually use the withdrawal method, unless I am with a one time or short term partner I dont use condoms."
21468,Have not been pregnant.
21469,I have the arm implant  I had it the full 5 years and never once used a condom.
21470,Never got pregnant.
21471,I removed it when it was time and currently got it again !
21472,This second time around my body is acting a bit strange so im a little concerned but its only been maybe 2 months so im going to give it 6 months before I decide if this BC is still right for me.
21473,No pregnancies at all though!
21474,Still not using anything other that this BC.
21475,"I've been on the pill for 5 years, relied on it as my only contraceptive many times, so far 0 pregnancy scares and 0 side effects."
21476,"I've used many methods over the past 20ish years including various combo pills, nuvaring, nexplanon, the norethindrone minipill, and now the Slynd minipill."
21477,I have been with my husband since I started BC as a teen so I know and trust he would support my choice if a pregnancy happened consequently I don't use a backup method if I am on one of these methods (unless I was sick or something else puts me at increased risk of course).
21478,"I have never had a failure, or even a serious scare to be honest."
21479,"I am a very diligent medication user though and make sure I really understand what to do if sick, how long before something counts as missed, etc."
21480,I've never truly missed a pill/ring change (that I am aware of).
21481,There have been plenty of times too when I just used condoms because I wasn't on a hormonal BC due to side effects and such  still no failures but definitely more stressful for me.Something that helps ease my worries is having a plan if a failure were to happen.
21482,"It might just be a conversation with your partner, it might be an emergency fund set aside to cover expenses, travel details to get appropriate care, etc."
21483,whatever helps you know you can make the best decision for yourself should that happen.
21484,Ive been using the combo pill since I was 17 (am 37 now) and Ive never been pregnant.
21485,My current partner has had a vasectomy but I use condoms with any new partners.
21486,When I was young and dumb I did not but fortunately the worse that happened was a case pf chlamydia.
21487,in my experience w the depo shot (was on it for a little over a year) it was really good at preventing pregnancy but being off it for 6 years now and my body has never been the same  severely irregular periods to the point i think i may be infertile  lowered sex drive and natural lubricant very rarely do i discharge also.
21488,"hoping this wont be your experience though, but yea depo is the worst birth control if you consider all the side effects to it"
21489,"I changed my to a new birth control patch on Sunday (scheduled day), the following day (Monday) I had to change to a new patch because it wasn't sticking."
21490,"That same day, I had sex."
21491,He came inside and I was still protected!
21492,I was on the patch for a week prior.
21493,"Other than a horrid looking decidual cast, I had no other repercussions."
21494,Hope this calms you
21495,"Im 23, Ive been on different types of bc (pill, patch, shot) since I was 16."
21496,Never used condom or withdrawal and I never had a pregnancy scare.
21497,As long as youre using it right youll be fine
21498,"for what its worth, Ive been with the same partner for almost 5 years  stupidly relying on pullout a lot of the times, and ive never been pregnant."
21499,"7 months of which were on the pill, but may not be too relevant"
21500,Ive used birth control for 14 years and havent gotten pregnant.
21501,"Mostly the pill no condoms, but also just condoms, just the iud too"
21502,"My ugliness really wor... oh, you meant actual BC.Jokes aside, 5 years of OCP and a little over 2 years of the Mirena IUD has kept me babyfree."
21503,"Once I'm with a consistent or serious partner, I don't use condoms."
21504,"Ive been on a pill on and off for about 5y, rest of the time weve been using condoms or just a pull out method."
21505,Never been pregnant and I dont have any health issues as far as I know.
21506,Was on Junel Fe (a pill).
21507,Had so much condomless sex that he literally put me to sleep.
21508,No pregnancies or even pregnancy scares.
21509,I got off the pill and started using condoms and still no pregnancy or pregnancy scares.
21510,Was on the pill for 6 years with no issue.
21511,Got off of it a few days ago because my body just wasnt agreeing with birth control anymore but it worked great for protection!
21512,"Been two years for Me on a mix of implant and pills, and suffice to say we've never  been Carful in the act!"
21513,No scares at all
21514,"Used the pill for like 5 years, no withdrawal or backup birth control, never got pregnant."
21515,"Now I have the Mirena IUD and I love it, Im not afraid of getting pregnant."
21516,"I used to have similar anxiety worrying about the effectiveness of things, I would take a pregnancy test every month, but I think the anxiety goes away when you find a birth control you trust and after months and months of not getting pregnant its just like ok. Im fine."
21517,"Does it count that bc made my libido disappear so I didn't have any sex whilst on it, therefore preventing pregnancy."
21518,"Not the bc I wanted, but the bc I got."
21519,Pill 15 yrs!
21520,My boyfriend and I have been together for three years.
21521,"I was on the pill for the first year, and have had an IUD for the past two years."
21522,"I amnot to put it too delicatelya cum dumpster (frequent sex, no condoms, no pullout)."
21523,Not a hint of a pregnancy scare.
21524,used depo and condoms for 6 years.
21525,been using condoms for a year and a half now.
21526,Never been pregnant.
21527,depo is  effective when taken properly BUT I will say it completely stopped my period the entire time I was on it which may be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it.
21528,It is recommended you only take Depo for 2 years.
21529,No one told me that (why didn't i do my research before getting it?
21530,Bc i was put on it at 16 by my parents and didn't have a say in it and my doctor recommended it year after year.)
21531,and my hormones are so unbelievably fucked up trying to withdrawl from it now.
21532,I was on pill for 6 years and now have been with IUD for 4 years.
21533,Never used condom nor pull out nor calendar at the same time.
21534,Never been pregnant.
21535,"On pill, the sex frequency was max 12 times a week, usually less."
21536,"On IUD, I've had sex on average 34 times a week."

21541,"Im on the birth control pill, there was a vacation where my fianc and I pretty much tested the shit out of it with no pull out everyday for a month."
21542,If thats not a clear sign that birth control works I dont know what will.
21543,But also my friend was on the depo shot at one point and she never got pregnant on hers either.
21544,And she switched to nexplanon and also never got pregnant.
21545,The only time she got pregnant was when she got the nexplanon taken out and wanted to start a family.
21546,I was on the pill for 13 years.
21547,Never pulled out and zero pregnancy scares.
21548,"Been on a low dose combined pill on and off since 15, now 21 and been taking it non stop for a year and a half."
21549,"No pregnancies or pregnancy scares, using it as my only method."
21550,I was on the pill for 7 years then switched to the copper IUD earlier this year.
21551,No scares at all!
21552,went on Depo for 3 months.
21553,didnt work for me as i had a miscarriage after a month being on it
21554,That makes me calm down a bit!
21555,I wish I could use the pill because depo has some side affects.
21556,But the pill has estrogen which I cannot use sadly
21557,Thank you!
21558,I just needed to hear a success story!
21559,I know everything we do have a risk.
21560,"People smoke (can get cancer), we drive (can get in accidents)."
21561,So we are always taking risks.
21562,Its part of life.
21563,"I'm new to sex, so I just need to get used to that new risk in my life!"
21564,Like people getting used to driving.
21565,"The phobia is just making it a bit harder, but I'm getting there!"
21566,Thank you again for this.
21567,"He wears condoms near my next shot date (2 weeks before next shot, and 2 weeks after shot) just to be safer."
21568,I feel relaxed again.
21569,Thank you again haha
21570,Thank you!!
21571,I'm so happy seeing the comments because dealing with tokophobia is harse
21572,Thank you!
21573,It really helps reading posts about successes with bc!
21574,"on slynd, sometimes i get periods, sometimes i dont."
21575,i have tests on hand.
21576,always negative though!
21577,Thats amazing!
21578,It always amazes me how that little device holds so much power!
21579,Like it defies biology.
21580,Its really interresting how birth control can help with planning pregnancies and preventing them.
21581,I'm so happy it worked well for you!
21582,!
21583,"You can use a pill, actually!"
21584,"They're called ""minipills""!"
21585,"The downside is, other than Slynd, they have to be taken in a threehour time window to not be considered ""missed""."
21586,Try a non hormonal (copper) IUD.
21587,Side effects are mostly just increased cramping when your period comes around but I cant tolerate hormonal BC and ive had a copper IUD for years with few issues.
21588,"Very low failure rate, and the failures that happen are due to the iud being out of place/too low in the uterus which can happen sometimes but if youre getting yearly checkups with ultrasound imaging to ensure its still in the right place then that prevents that."
21589,"I'll be honest as someone with the same phobia that it never really went away for me, and it took some time and work with my current bf to even be comfortable with being around semen because I was so terrified."
21590,"But it did get better, especially seeing all my friends who are child free using BC, and speaking to my mother who grew up in the era of only having pills and diaphragms available.She apparently had her birth control (and fertility tracking) so drilled down, she only got pregnant when she wanted kids with my dad and had my brother and I (as she very proudly proclaimed, she got pregnant literally right on the month she scheduled it, not sooner or later lol)."
21591,There's a three year difference between us.
21592,"If that's not a success story, I don't know what is!"
21593,If it werent for my busy scedule I would have taken it!
21594,Thank you for being honest!
21595,"Its a long road ahead for me, but the support on here is really helping me!"
21596,Thats amazing!
21597,"That your mom only got pregnant when she wanted to, it shows us that it is possible to be safe and not have unplanned pregnancies happen."
21598,Thank you for your comment because it really helped me.
21599,It feels like I'm snapped back to reality haha

21607,Is anyone on microgynon20?
21608,This is my first month and I haven't stopped spotting since I started.
21609,I was on a break from the pill but before that was on Diane35 with no issues.
21610,Asked to switch over since Microgynon is subsidized in NZ and Diane isn't.
21611,Just wanting to know when the spotting stopped for anyone who experienced this?
21612,Thanks!Edit spotting stopped at two and a half weeks in case people were curious.
21613,Not sure if I'll spot again after I have the withdrawal bleed.

21627,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
21628,Its probably a just withdrawal bleed from the drop in hormones after you removed the patch (even though it was only on for 3 days)
21629,"Ive been on the pill for probably over 2 years now (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol, 1mg) but as Im being more sexually active, was thinking about switching to the implant to give me peace of mind about getting pregnant."
21630,"Before I started this pill, I was on a higher dosage and it made me extremely depressed/suicidal so I stopped that and started the one Im currently on."
21631,Im 18 years old and was wondering if anyone can give me advice on if I should do it or not.
21632,All im reading is horror stories after horror stories and my past experience with the higher dosage makes me nervous to get it.
21633,"If anyone can offer their knowledge/advice, thatd be great."
21634,Thank you
21635,"Getting the implant is an easy, painless procedure so you shouldnt be concerned about that."
21636,The healing is also fine as long as you dont hit/knock it about.
21637,"I cannot say anything positive about the impact the hormones had on me, as it affected my mental health and made me bleed for 8 and 1/2 months."
21638,"That being said, its different for everybody and nobodys personal account can necessarily tell you the impacts it can/will have on you."
21639,Good luck x
21640,I've been on the implanon for 7 months and have had no weight gain and no side effects except for extra long periods (2 weeks) every now and again.
21641,I would 1000 recommend it!
21642,You won't know what works for you until you try
21643,The implant is easy in and easy out.
21644,If you change your mind of happen to have side effects its not issue getting it removed.
21645,"I actually loved mine for a couple months, however any form of progesterone ends up giving me joint pain."
21646,This is such a rare side effect.
21647,"When I was pregnant, the pregnancy hormones gave me horrible joint pain as well."
21648,"But anyways, like I said its such an easy insertion and easy removal."
21649,Birth control can be trial and error.
21650,Ive gone through many forms and have settled with the copper iud.
21651,Everyone is different
21652,Ive had mine about a year and a half and I love it.

21658,Guess Ill be the horror story person// nexplanon made me into a literal demon of a person.
21659,"I cried every time my fianc and I would argue, I would have breakthrough bleeding for 1530 days every 46 months, I had to work out for 3 hours everyday to lose any weight, I didnt want to eat anything for days sometimes, my hormones were just so poorly balanced it was insane."
21660,I dont know how my fianc dealt with me.
21661,"But like a month after getting it out, I said hey its been forever since Ive cried."
21662,And we realized it was most likely nexplanon.
21663,I gained 50lbs in 3 years from nexplanon despite being very active.
21664,"No matter how hard I tried, I couldnt shed the weight and it really affected my self esteem."
21665,The bleeding wasnt heavy thankfully but it was annoying.
21666,It also came with cramps and excessive hunger.
21667,Im on junel now and it worked for 6 months and now Im about to get off due to experiencing crippling nausea and other aggressive side effects.
21668,"I have triple checked, no Im not pregnant"
21669,Ive started yaz and started taking the first pack for 27 days and had my period for the whole 25 days.
21670,"Period ended two days ago, had no more bleeding."
21671,Today woke up and I have blood again.
21672,"Quite a lot, medium spotting."
21673,Hate this and would like to know if its normal for someone who started the first month on yaz.. have no ability to get a doctor now and dont know what to do.
21674,Omg I am experiencing a similar thing!!

21682,Hi all!
21683,Ive been on a mini pill (heather) for almost 4 weeks now  have experienced quite a good amount of bleeding since.
21684,"I am also almost 3 mo postpartum, stopped ebf at 2 months."
21685,I take my pill at the same time everyday  have never missed or skipped.
21686,I had what I considered an 8 day long period about 5 days ago.

21721,Thank you so much for the information
21722,Looking for advice and support!A month ago I had my second IUD placed.
21723,I switched from the Kyleena to the Mirena.
21724,My new provider cut my strings noticeably shorter and about a week ago I couldnt feel them anymore.I went for a checkup this week and had my doc check the IUDs placement.
21725,She told me everything looks good and that the strings shifted back because I have a tilted uterus (this was news to me).
21726,Wondering if I should have the IUD replaced so I can have the strings cut longer?
21727,Is this irrational?It makes me so anxious to know Ill never be able to feel my strings.
21728,"I had the Kyleena for 5 years and while it truly protected me from pregnancy, I could always feel my strings."
21729,My current situation is uncharted territory.
21730,"I feel like this situation is entirely up to you and your own comfort level, personally I would want to be able to feel the strings because thats one thing that can bring you comfort that you are indeed protected."
21731,If you are able to get it switched out with no issues then I dont see why not.

21745,"Spotting can happen, your body is getting used to the hormones that are being added to your body via birth control.When I first started birth control I had bleeding for two weeks, and when I switched to a different pill I also had bleeding for two weeks."
21746,It is a common thing that can happen and for me at least after the first month and the placebo week it started to even out a little.
21747,"Everyone is different though and it may take a shorter amount of time or a longer amount of time, however this is how it happens for some."
21748,"I have taken the pill for 4 years no issue, I usually take 2 pill packs back to back then have my break however for the first time in the middle of my second pill pack I started to get an uncomfortable feeling like Im about to start my period and sore breasts,  I initially ignored it and thought it was weird as its not a normal side effect to have and thought it would go away, however it got worse."
21749,It got to a point where I decided in the middle of my pack to come off of the pill for 4 days to see if I could jump start my withdrawal bleed to get some kind of relief.
21750,"So far it hasnt worked and its getting worse, I was curled up in a ball on my bed screaming and crying, its not exactly like period cramps and before I started the pill I had excruciating period cramps, its more uncomfortable and constant, I also got lower back pain (again a very usual symptom for me) and its beginning to become debilitating."
21751,Ive not gone back on my pill yet but I know Ill have to (Ive only been off of it 2 days) I am mindful Im not supposed to take a break in the middle of a pack but I couldnt bare the feeling  I had over 21 days in my system.

21760,what pill are you on???
21761,i went on a birth control pill for 4 months  this same thing happened to me.
21762,it stopped the same exact day i stopped taking my birth controlto me it was like a severe cramp.
21763,not like a period cramp but almost like my stomach was swollen  burning  i had the diarrhea every single morning.
21764,this would start 15 minutes after taking my birth control pill.
21765,Hello!
21766,Ive been debating posting this or not.
21767,"But I am worried I might be pregnant, while having the Kyleena IUD.Before getting the Kyleena IUD, I had very irregular periods."
21768,"However, since Ive gotten it placed (in April) my periods have regulated and have been consistent."
21769,"However, Im not even sure if I had a period last month."
21770,Every other day I was spotting very lightly.
21771,"A week goes by, and then I experienced the same spotting almost every other day for 5 days."
21772,Then two weeks ago I noticed my discharge was producing more then usual.
21773,"It was very watery, but also kind of chunky and brown?"
21774,"I didnt have any itching so I dont think it was an infection, I could be wrong though."
21775,"This week my heartburn has been thru the roof, extremely nauseous, and have thrown up multiple times which isnt normal for me."
21776,I eat food and three bites in I want to puke.
21777,I feel hungry but no appetite.
21778,"My mouth tastes like metal constantly, and smells are so putrid."
21779,"I took two Walmart cheap tests, yesterday and today."
21780,They both were negative.
21781,"I feel as though I saw the faintest line, but I think it was my mind tricking me because I took a photo and cant see it, so that is why I think Im just being paronid."
21782,"To give more context, the last two months I have been weaning off of Lexapro."
21783,"The side effects online sayAppetite changes (generally, this will be opposite the appetite you experienced while on Lexapro).Brain zaps (the sensation that small electrical shocks are running through ones brain).Dizziness, fatigue, or confusion.Headaches.Insomnia.Fever.Nausea or indigestion.Sweating.Weight changes (often, weight loss).Dry mouth.Frequent urination.Altered perception of certain senses, such as smell or taste.Which would make sense because Im experiencing some of those."
21784,"Why Im concerned its pregnancys is because of the spotting, the discharge, and all the above."
21785,Do I go an buy a more accurate test?
21786,Or am I just being paranoid?
21787,Any responses would be helpful.
21788,Thank you
21789,"As the other poster said, I would go check with your gyno to make sure everything is going good, have them give you a test and also check to see if the iud is still doing good.Also as someone who just weened off of escitalopram (generic of Lexapro) the side effects are a bitch aint they?"
21790,Like good god they fucking sucked lmao.
21791,Like the moment I saw weening off of lexapro I knew you were having a time for sure.
21792,I still get the brain zaps and Ive been off of it for a week or two.

21812,If you had unprotected sex then I would take a test if it doesnt come in the next few days.
21813,"So withdrawal bleeds can sometimes be wonky, it isnt a period like in the normal sense since the combination pill prevents ovulation, thins the uterine lining, and thickens cervical mucus.Many people experience things like lighter withdrawal bleeds or even none altogether, sometimes it might be spotting in the week, sometimes it shows up damn near when youre about to start the next pack, for some it is just like a normal period just a little lighter before they were on birth control, and some like me just dont have them altogether.It is something that can happen on the pill, and it doesnt necessarily mean pregnancy, because if that were the case then Im carrying a toddler inside my body right now because its been about 3 or 4 years."
21814,"Take a test to ease your mind if you need to, but the odds are in your favor for sure"
21815,you dont have periods on birth control.
21816,its called Withdrawal bleeding.
21817,usually its little to no bleeding every single month depending on how long youve been on birth control
21818,It was supposed to come either today or yesterday and all Im getting is just brown how would I know if I need to take a test I thought the pill helps protect
21819,I would take a test for peace of mind.
21820,My doc told me my pill is 97 effective (vylibra) and sources online say between 97 and 99 effective so there's a little chance.

21829,Nobody can tell you if youll get pregnant or not.
21830,You need to test 2 weeks after sex for an accurate result and 3 weeks after for a definite one.
21831,You need to either use the pills you have for yuzpe as regular birth control or use condoms.

21841,She said it shouldnt affect my mood swings and that itll be mostly hormones from my own body that will be working.

21854,Hi!
21855,Ive been on the mini pill for the past 3 years.
21856,Got off it a week ago bc my gyno  endocrinologist recommended it to check my hormones and to see how I feel in general.
21857,I didnt mind it bc Im single and not really active.
21858,"I really like my gynecologist, which is the main reason I followed her advice, but I also really disliked the endocrinologist that I visited bc he kept dismissing my concerns and my past experience with getting off a combo pill."
21859,"Long story short, the endocrinologist told me that I need to get blood work done to check my hormones and said that it doesnt matter when I do it."
21860,"From what I know, it does matter when I do the bloodwork."
21861,"Not only based on the cycle, but also given that I just gotoff birth control."
21862,I dont wanna go to another endocrinologist bc  and my insurance has already approved the tests.
21863,Would anyone know if doing the blood work in the next week or so would be a bad idea?
21864,Is it going to be accurate given that my hormones are probably all over the place right now?
21865,Tysm!
21866,!
21867,Hormones from bc are out of your system within a week it can just take months for your natural hormones to regulate which is why some people take months to get a cycle again.
21868,They may do blood work now and then later it kinda depends.

21875,i been on blisovi 1/20 and junel 1/20 and i can honestly say it works wonders.
21876,granted im not out here getting the club shot up but my periods are no longer painful.
21877,mostly it is spotting.
21878,the downsides of this is being more emotional and having a plummeting sex drive.
21879,it makes me so dry and i hate it.
21880,"again, im 19 and yea who at 19 wants to feel restricted."
21881,i feel like i want to switch to another pill that somehow doesnt interfere with my sex drive/libido.
21882,or even no pill at all but i know itll be a high risk of me losing a ton of blood and painful cramps.
21883,i sometimes take my pills at odd parts of the day so she can be a little juicier.
21884,any suggestions on pills or just advice?
21885,I would talk to your doctor.
21886,Everyone will react differently.
21887,My favorite form of birth control so far has been an iud.
21888,I had Mirena with bad effects but switched to Paraguard and really like it.
21889,"However, given your history with your periods paraguard may not be the best for you."
21890,It can make your periods heavier and longer.
21891,If you liked that your periods have basically stopped and you don't have a bad reaction to hormones Mirena may be a good option for you.
21892,My periods completely stopped with it.
21893,That part I miss.
21894,I didn't have any issues with my sex drive or dryness on it.
21895,However I never had that problem on any pill before either

21916,"My doctor told me it reduces the effects of the copper (very bad cramping, heavier periods) and it's actually minisized, so insertion should be less painful."

21959,I had a negative experience with the copper IUD but switched to Skyla after because it's the smallest and lowest hormone dose available in the US.
21960,I'm about to get it replaced with another one next week.
21961,I love it.
21962,"Made my periods lighter, insertion was less hellish than the copper, haven't really noticed any side effects."
21963,"Certainly never noticed it moving around during sex  if properly placed, that shouldn't be a thing."
21964,"The only thing about rough sex is that during certain points in my cycle my cervix might be a little more sensitive, maybe due to the IUD in there."
21965,"Overall not a hindrance though, and most importantly, I never got pregnant."
21966,Remember that on this sub there will always be a disproportionate amount of horror stories because most people don't post about the time when they found a birth control that was just fine.
21967,I got copper iud and it was the best decision ever.
21968,It wasnt that bad to insert and I feel like myself again after taking the pill for some years.
21969,"Im wondering during the week of the white pills, if my boyfriend finishes in me, do i have a higher chance of getting pregnant since they are nonhormonal?"
21970,No you are protected during your pill free week as long as you took all your active pills and start your new pack on time.

21977,i  did
21978,hey everyone!!
21979,i'm in a little bit of a pickle and i wanted to see if anyone else has experienced/is experiencing what i'm currently dealing with.
21980,"(i'm tagging this as nsfw for the potentially queasy folks, trigger warnings for vomiting and the like."
21981,please let me know if this is a misuse of the tag!
21982,)i started taking cryselle at my doctor's recommendation two weeks ago because of a lot of things.
21983,"for one, my period has never been regular."
21984,i've gone months without it and having it suddenly reappear.
21985,"i would get super depressed 12 weeks before it would start (which was my usual indicator), sex usually hurts, my cramps are sometimes unbearable, and i would bleed too much."
21986,"i'm 23, so my friends have urged me to get an ultrasound to check for endometriosis and/or pcos, but that's a different post for another time."
21987,"long story short, i needed to do something about this, so i hopped on birth control."
21988,the first week was fine.
21989,little to no side effects.
21990,then came the second week.
21991,"on labor day i started feeling nauseous, and i woke up the next morning vomiting my guts out."
21992,"there was a little drop of blood every now and then, but i didn't really think much of it."
21993,there's only been two mornings this week that i haven't thrown up (and it's always at 5ish am?
21994,"i take the pill at 1130pm, and im wondering if that's part of the issue, but i work weird hours, so y'know)."
21995,"yesterday i started cramping, just enough to make me uncomfortable and need a heating pad and some painkillers."
21996,"the blood in my vomit came back a little, but again, not thinking much of it bc my throat could just be super irritated."
21997,"i started spotting yesterday, when the cramps started, and it's been brownish."
21998,"my last period ended on august 30th, so i'm assuming it's just leftover blood?i've definitely lost too much weight in a week."
21999,"i haven't been able to keep much of anything down, except for the occasional saltine or other small, bland thing."
22000,"i haven't had a proper meal in days, and yet i feel very bloated and constipated all the time but i also have diarrhea(?)"
22001,"(i know, i'm lost too)."
22002,"my lower tummy has been feeling harder, but im not pregnant (i think this is another symptom of endometriosis and pcos, but again, probably a different post for another time)."
22003,"and honestly, the only position i feel mildly comfortable in is a fetal position."
22004,"i've still been super nauseous, i've been sobbing constantly and i've been super emotional, and i feel broken."
22005,ive had to call into work twice this week because of all of this.
22006,"i feel awful, and i'm not sure im strong enough to wait for 23 months until my body adjusts to the medicine."
22007,"i have a doctor's appointment on monday for a medical opinion, but i wanted to ask, has anyone else dealt with anything similar?"
22008,is this normal?
22009,"thank you for taking the time to read this, i appreciate any and all help!! )"

22013,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
22014,Those are some really serious side effects!!
22015,"The side effects themselves (nausea, depression, etc.)"
22016,"are normal, but yours are very severe."
22017,"They arent a sign that youre dying or anything, so please dont feel worried about that!"
22018,But theyre really bad and absolutely a reason to quit taking your birth control.
22019,"If your doctor tries to tell you to just give it more time, then they dont understand how severe these side effects are."
22020,"Luckily, there are plenty of other birth controls that can help with PMDD and painful, heavy periods!"
22021,Are you seeing a gynecologist?
22022,"If not, itd be a good idea to have a gyno managing your birth control."
22023,Gynecologists are generally much more knowledgeable about what birth control options exist and whats worked best for patients with similar issues.
22024,"Btw, are you experiencing any barriers stopping you from seeing a doctor about endometriosis and/or PCOS?"
22025,"i almost cried reading this, thank you so much for the validation!!!"
22026,"3 yes i'll be going to a gynecologist on monday, though it's a doctor i don't think i've met before so that makes me a little nervous."
22027,"i did a telehealth visit with another doctor yesterday just for a doctor's note for work, and he also recommended i stop taking it."
22028,"my fiance is worried about me stopping though, because she thinks the side effects will get worse as it gets out of my system, but the more i'm told to stop taking it the more i think i should."
22029,"the only barrier is me, to be honest  my anxiety has been so bad lately that i haven't been able to bring myself to make the phone call."
22030,"i will probably ask the gynecologist if i could schedule that then and there, and then i'll finally have an answer!"
22031,"thank you again for your comment, hearing that i'm not dying is absolutely what i needed ') 3"
22032,im glad it helped!
22033,stopping birth control wouldnt cause these side effects to get worse.
22034,"youd probably have a withdrawal bleed, but thats it."
22035,"do you think it might it help to bring a support person (friend, girlfriend, etc.)"
22036,to the appointment?
22037,another thing that helps me is writing out everything i want to talk about before the appointment.
22038,knowing that it doesnt matter if i get flustered because i can just refer to my prewritten list is really comforting for me.
22039,hopefully everything works out!!
22040,"depending on what kind of testing your doctor wants, you might be able to just do it during your appointment."
22041,I guess I accidentally took the next days pill thursday or yesterday?
22042,I have no memory of doing this!
22043,But its Saturday and I dont have a pill for today now.
22044,Should I just skip today and take my tomorrow night one or do I just take Sundays?
22045,What do I do Im freaking out.

22053,Has anyone had implanon and has experienced no pregnancies for the whole 3 years of having it?
22054,A friend of mine has hers and wasnt going to expire till next year but shes been experiencing preimplant PMS symptoms so shell have it replaced soonIm worried that my implant wont be effective for the 3 whole years.
22055,My periods arent like my preimplant.
22056,Currently theyre kinda regular but also not since i experience spotting.
22057,"Nexplanon has been shown to be effective for up to 5 years, actually."
22058,It is approved for 3 years.
22059,"The dosage may decrease over time, but the efficacy remains the same.The most common side effect of the arm implant is irregular bleeding."
22060,PMS and side effects of hormonal contraceptives often overlap.
22061,"You dont have a real, menstrual period with the implant in place."
22062,The implant actually prevents pregnancy for 5 years!
22063,"The dose released decreases over time, which can cause changes in side effects, but it stays high enough to prevent pregnancy for 5 years."
22064,"Nexplanon is very very effective (like, more effective than a vasectomy)  pregnancies are extraordinarily rare."
22065,I had mine for 3 years.
22066,Got it removed as soon as I hit 3 years.
22067,I hated that damn thing

22071,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
22072,I had Nexplanon for a few months a few years ago.
22073,The irregular bleeding was frustrating for me.
22074,I was constantly spotting.
22075,I ended up getting it out a few months in.
22076,But then I know people that love it and had no major side effects!
22077,Im switching to Kyleena IUD soon
22078,I kept mine 5 years based on advice from Planned Parenthood.
22079,"Why go through more removals/insertions than necessary IMO, unless you start having different side effects or something like that of course."
22080,"Definitely depends on your comfort level, but I was reassured by the studies and Planned Parenthood and it is already the most effective method out there to start with."
22081,No scares or anything for me.
22082,I'm currently on my 4th nexplanon.
22083,"My first i had for 2 years, had issues with scar tissue and site pain for the first 6 months, it got bent so i went for replacement and found out at removal it was incorrectly placed."
22084,My second i switched out at 2.5 years when i had a period 2 months in a row as for the first 2 years had no bleeding whatsoever and panicked the hormones had run out.
22085,"My third i again had replaced at 2.5 years as i had just got into a new relationship where i planned for it to be used to prevent pregnancy not just for PCOS like my previous 3 implants during which i was not sexually active, and felt safer getting a new one."
22086,"My current implant is 17 months old, and i just had my first month with spotting on this implant, the previous 16 months no bleeding."
22087,"I will prefer to get switched out at 2.5 years as i am quite significantly overweight, which i've read can run the hormones out faster, but absolutely no way would i go any longer than 3 years to the day."
22088,Do you know if its the same as Implanon?
22089,"Hmm, Planned Parenthood told me that too, but when I went to my new OBGYN they were a bit baffled at that and had me remove it, stating there's still not enough studies that support that and I should be replacing it to be 100 certain."
22090,Has there been recent updates to that data?
22091,"(Not disputing btw, just gotten conflicting information)."
22092,Thats reassuring.
22093,Thank you!
22094,Been really worried that i could get pregnant before the expiry date.
22095,Why did you hate it?
22096,My sister had it and she had it taken out before the three years were up.
22097,She said it made her feel crazy.
22098,"She was going through a lot at the time, so I'm not sure how much of those feelings were caused by the implant or the circumstances."
22099,"Also, she said the doctor was kinda rude and resistant about taking it out."
22100,This is the second time ive had mine and am also currently spotting non stop .
22101,I cant stand it.
22102,The first time around I did not have this problem.
22103,Im gonna give it 6 months .. i was told it was normal??
22104,!
22105,"Its the same hormone, same dose, as far as I understand."
22106,Nexplanon is just the updated version of Implanon.
22107,I would double check to see which you had inserted.
22108,There will likely not be more studies for 5 years because research is expensive and the manufacturer won't want to pay for it.
22109,The data is based on 204 women using the implant for 5 years with zero pregnancies.
22110,It's unlikely that the study was a fluke.
22111,"Planned Parenthood probably places more implants than any other org and have been recommending 5 years for a few years now, and I would imagine if pregnancies were being observed in implant users past 3 years they would update their guidance."
22112,Its definitely evidencebased.
22113,There have been multiple studies with hundreds of patients (heres one(
22114,"To me I feel like its all based on comfort level, like I know for me when I eventually switch to it, Im gonna just go by the three years, but for some they are comfortable with the 5 years."
22115,But it is effective for the entire duration.
22116,"I dont have depression or anxiety (thankfully) but nexplanon gave me horrible depression, anxiety and migraines."
22117,Also acne and bleeding.
22118,I got it removed and got the IUD and feel amazing again
22119,"It happened to me too where i bled for 23 months and then by the end of the first year, my period kinda got regular."
22120,i still spot but its bearable.
22121,I just wasnt patient enough and I think I got it out before 6 months /
22122,Okay!
22123,Thank you!
22124,Yeah that's completely fair!
22125,"As crazy at the implant made me, I do wish my OBGYN could have let me keep it a couple more years as I found placement and removal quite painful and traumatic!"
22126,I just started my third week of the Yaz pill and Im just wondering the following questions1) can I take it within a 3 hour window or does it have to be same time to be effective?2) Does Yaz protect me enough from being pregnant that my boyfriend can finish inside me?
22127,Or is that risky?3.
22128,")if you went on the pill for acne, how long until it cleared it?4.)"
22129,"I dont really understand how bc works, so if my bf did finish in me, and since the period is fake how would I know Im not pregnant?TIA!"
22130,!
22131,1.
22132,"I think Yaz has a 12 hour window, so yes you should be fine to take it within a 3 hour time frame."
22133,"Check the information that came with the pill to make sure, it should say on there."
22134,Taking it at exactly the same time is recommended just to set up a routine with it.2.
22135,"Yes, the effectiveness of the pill (99 when taken correctly) is calculated assuming a partner finishing inside every time."
22136,3.
22137,"I cannot answer this question because it doesn't apply to me, sorry, I hope you get some responses."
22138,4.
22139,"The Yaz (combined) pill works by stopping your ovulation (so no egg is released), thickening your cervical mucus (so killing sperm/preventing it from getting near where an egg would be if you were ovulating), and thinning your uterine lining (so if, somehow, an egg and sperm did meet, it would not be able to implant)."
22140,"The fake period can be used as a sign you're not pregnant, however some people find that the effect of thinning the uterine lining also makes their periods much lighter/stops them all together."
22141,"If you are taking your pills correctly, you don't have to worry about pregnancy so you don't need to worry about getting your withdrawal bleed or not."
22142,"Some people find they like to buy a bulk of cheap tests so they can check monthly anyway, but you do not actually need to do that."

22146,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
22147,1.
22148,Yaz has more than a 3 hour window.2.
22149,As long as you are taking your birth control around the same time every day then yes.3.
22150,everyone is different.
22151,i didnt start noticing a difference for quite a while.
22152,it actually got worse before it got better.
22153,"after i quit taking birth control, my acne came back again in less than 48 hours.4."
22154,you will only know if youve been taking your birth control accurately.
22155,i suggest setting an alarm every day at the exact same time so you can take your birth control.
22156,"if you do that, you pretty much should be perfectly fine."
22157,you dont have a period on birth control.
22158,its called withdrawal bleeding and its only light spotting at the end of the month.
22159,I saw my doctor about a side effect I was having from the pill and he minimized my concerns about serious side effects.
22160,The biggest issue I have is that I am 44 years old and have been placed on the combo pill.
22161,I asked 2 doctors if this was the safest option for me but both seemed to ignore my concern.
22162,The other one told me that it doesnt matter what I choose and that they all have serious risks.
22163,That discouraged me because I know my fertility is way less now but im worried about getting pregnant as my sex life has really picked upI guess that no kids left in the house thing.
22164,I dont know how concerned I should be as we always just use the pull out method which I know is not safe.
22165,But we have been using it for 20 years with no problems yet our frequency of sex was low all that time (maybe once a month).
22166,My husband struggles to use condoms as he has problems keeping an erection.
22167,I just dont know what to do.
22168,Putting anything in my body permanently or semipermanently scares me.
22169,I wanted the pill because then I feel more in control.
22170,Is the mini pill my best option then?
22171,And why did my doctor say all of them are unsafe?
22172,Is the mini pill unsafe too?
22173,Mostly worried about life threatening side effects.
22174,Everything has its risks but most of them are low enough that thousands of women are on the pill and mini pill and take it daily for years without any concerns.
22175,They are potentially serious but any medication can have potentially serious risks.
22176,"The best method is the one that you're most comfortable with which does sound like the pill, and I can absolutely relate to not wanting anything inside you that you aren't in control of."
22177,"That said, you could consider looking into the patch or the ring as alternatives to the pill if you decide its not right for you anymore, the patch you change weekly and the ring monthly, but you do it yourself at home so it's not 'in' you like the coil is"
22178,"I watch Mama Dr Jones on YouTube sometimes, and shes mentioned multiple times that any risks of birth control are usually much smaller risks than when youre actually pregnant (for instance, some bc increases chance of blood clots, but pregnancy increases that risk much more than bc does).I personally take the mini pill, its a little less forgiving if youre late taking it, but it was a better option for me than a combined pill as I get migraines."
22179,Could you possibly speak to someone from planned parenthood (or similar) as they may be able to answer your questions and give more time to youre concerns!
22180,All birth control does have serious risks but these serious risks are extremely uncommon.
22181,Im talking less than 1/1000 people would experience them.
22182,Most people experience common side effects which are pretty similar across the board for most hormonal birth control options.However if youre experiencing certain side effects that are limiting or causing issue in your life more than a minor inconvenience you can always get a second opinion from a sexual health or planned parenthood organisation rather than sticking only to what your doctor says.
22183,The mini pill may be your best option.
22184,Estrogen containing birth control methods are the ones more likely to have risk as we get older.
22185,Id get another opinion and go with the mini pill over combo.
22186,Its generally recommended when youre over 35.
22187,"Im terms of serious side effects, a major one is blood clots but thats only a concern with estrogen."
22188,Progesterone doesnt cause blood clots.
22189,Im not sure what other serious side effects they may be talking about but overall mini pills are safer once you get older.
22190,"Every medication has serious risks, they are just usually extremely rare."
22191,You might have an increased chance of risk because of your age but the serious risks are still very rare side effects and if you are okay with taking the risk you should be able to.
22192,You might have better luck with a different doctor.
22193,Look into it.
22194,"Consider your family history of breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and liver issues."
22195,"If liver issues are a problem, look into the mini pill."
22196,"Better yet, check on your liver before you decide as from my understanding the combo pill is Worse for liver issues (both are a bit rough on the liver but estrogen is Worse)."
22197,At least make an informed decision.
22198,Don't just take whatever your doctor gives you.
22199,"If anything, considering what he's saying, I might look for a new doctor, if you're able."
22200,Compare the potential risks of any of the medications to the know health risks of pregnancy.
22201,You will see that contraceptives are far safer than pregnancy.
22202,All medication has risk.
22203,Any medication or even herb that that has the potential do really good things for you has the potential do also do harm.
22204,"For people around your age most doctors recommend something with less hormones, like lo loestrin fe, IUD, patch, ring, yaz etc."
22205,but it really depends on what you feel best on.
22206,"Dont smoke, get exercise, eat well all reduces your risk."
22207,Everything has potential side effects.
22208,Im 40 and on the NuvaRing.
22209,My doctor said the hormones are more localized in the vagina so to me that makes more sense where its not in my whole system.
22210,"Also, I can place and remove myself which I love."

22215,Get a new dr
22216,yeah i got talked out of it by my late 20s by a dr explaining the risks to me as i got older with blood clots etc.once i was diagnosed with hypertension in my 30s my dr told me to cease the combo pill and move to the mini pill.
22217,i preferred the combo pill personally (less side effects for me) but didnt want to risk it.
22218,"While yes, the combo pills have more clotting risk than progestinonly (mini pill), it is not true that they are preferred in someone over 35."
22219,This is true if that person smokes.
22220,"If the OP does not smoke and has no other contraindications to estrogen, at 35 (and really up until about age 50 or so), its discussing personal risk/benefit in terms of whats right for them."
22221,"Of course, patient preference should also weigh in to this decision!"
22222,Source Im a repro health provider (but not your provider and this is not medical advice).
22223,Did not know this thanks for clarifying!
22224,Just started experiencing this a few days after I had sex.
22225,"Im also bloated, had light brown spotting yesterday, nausea, had a poop cramp (gross sorry lol) right side pinch but I ovulated 5 days ago  im assuming its a few weeks before an expected period that I wont get anyway because they completely stopped."
22226,Of course the contraction feelings are short lived but super painful in that moment.
22227,I checked my strings last night  my cervix feels kinda low  my strings feel alot longer than im use to.
22228,So I guess its a positive sign that the iud is not swimming somewhere around my body.Im about 4 months into my hormonal IUD and everythings been going so great up to this point!
22229,"So the only answers I can find about online are pregnancy, iud trying to expel, iud pressing a nerve, imbedded iud or cyst."

22235,"Not sure what it was about, but I experienced this as well, with the Mirena IUD"
22236,So I've been taking norethindrone .35 for a little over 3 months to help control/stop my periods.
22237,I've been on the combination pill for years with no periods at all due to taking them continuously.
22238,Though I've all of a sudden started having side effects like my hair falling out among others.
22239,Any way I've been spotting almost every day.
22240,And am having a full period every 2 weeks.
22241,Will it ever stop?
22242,Will it ever get any better?
22243,Should I ask my doctor to increase my dose?
22244,Please help...
22245,I cannot live like this
22246,"Ive only been taking the mini pill for a month now, but my NP said it typically takes 3 months for your body to regulate to it."
22247,If youre having a rough time on it I would definitely chat with your doctor to see what would be the best option for you!
22248,Im sorry youre having a hard time with it (( everyone reacts differently and it fucking sucks its trial and error /

22253,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
22254,Doesnt sound ideal maybe try another option?
22255,All I can do is ask.
22256,Which I am willing to do.
22257,I have also researched another one that several articles say is the most popular but my Dr claims that her automated pharmaceutical software won't let her prescribe.
22258,I'm starting to think I need a new Dr and not just a new birth control.
22259,"So, let me give more of the backstory."
22260,I was originally put on birth control when I was 15 due to very heavy bleeding and cramping.
22261,My then doctor put me straight on the depo shot.
22262,I took that for nearly 10 years with NO bleeding at all until I discontinued to start my family.
22263,I had my son when I was 25 and immediately went back on birth control but at that time my obgyn suggested that I go with a different method.
22264,So I agreed and was put on lo lo estrogen.
22265,You only have a 4 day cycle while taking it.
22266,"I was so accustomed to not having a cycle, I took it in an order where I was taking 1 sugar pill once a week instead of 4 days in a row so as not to have a period."
22267,(Dr. Said it was fine).
22268,All the while I never wanted to have sex again.
22269,My libido completely disappeared and I just thought it was bc I had had a child.
22270,Not knowing that the depo shot has no estrogen but now I was taking a combination pill.
22271,My insurance company decided they would no longer pay for my birth control so I was put on the next best thing but it had a higher amount of estrogen which made my body go haywire.
22272,So my doctor thinks that I'm having an adverse reaction to the extra estrogen.
22273,Now here I am on the mini pill with no estrogen but bleeding all the time.
22274,My sex drive has magically returned though which is nice for me and my husband.
22275,The doctor suggested the IUD but I am petrified and will not do it.
22276,I was thinking about the implanon but was worried about it having even higher doses of the progesterone in it.
22277,Idk...
22278,I think I'm just going to give the mini pill a little while longer before I make any other changes.
22279,"Absolutely, so many doctors disregard you."
22280,Just keep pushing for what you want or yes try another doctor
22281,Can you try another mini pill like slynd?
22282,Its meant to be really good
22283,Hi.
22284,"My PCP was unfortunately very slow at refilling my birth control order (I was out of refills, so I had to ask for a new order)."
22285,It took 2 weeks to finally receive my new pack and I took it right away.
22286,I was not retaught that its best to take it the Sunday after your last period.. which I completely forgot about that rule because I started taking birth control 6 years ago and never had to stop it like this.
22287,Anyways..
22288,"I finished my last completed pack of hormonal birth control and then had to wait 2 weeks for my doctor to refill it and started taking it again which was mid cycle, 2 weeks after my period."
22289,Well now I am on the end of week 2 (6/7 pills for this week are gone with 1 to take tonight).
22290,My last period was august 11th and I was wondering when my next period would be with starting this new pack 2 weeks after my last period Im not sure if this is gonna throw anything off or what not.
22291,How does this impact protection against pregnancy?
22292,Please help me find the answers to this because Im not sure to ask and Im assuming my PCP doesnt know either (Im now switching PCP because this entire situation has me pretty upset).
22293,Thanks )

22297,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
22298,"The Sunday after your period advice only exists because if you start on a Sunday, the preprinted days on your pill packet will match the day you take your pill."
22299,You can start birth control on any day and at any point in your cycle.
22300,"If you start during the first 5 days of your period, youre protected immediately otherwise, protection starts when its time to take the 8th pill.Are you in combination birth control or Slynd?"
22301,"If so, youll typically get your period when you take the placebos in your current pack (so, about 2 weeks later than usual)."
22302,You dont have a cycle or true period on combo BC  you have a withdrawal bleed from the drop in hormones during break/ placebo days.
22303,"In my experience starting birth control mid cycle, the first two months i would.spot a little here and there until my body figured out the new pattern."
22304,"Now I usually start on day 19 of the 21 day active pills, and end on the 4th day of the placebo/inactive week."
22305,"I think they recommend a Sunday start not so much because its preprinted on the pack, but because that way you will theoretically never have your period on a weekend."
22306,With a typical 217 pack it aligns your placebo week to start on a Sunday.
22307,Just for the record!
22308,"Or I guess you could say, that is WHY they normally preprint the packs to start on Sundays."
22309,"So Im splitting hairs.Otherwise I 100 agree, they should get their period when the placebos start, 2 weeks later than usual."
22310,Its possible some breakthrough bleeding will happen earlier if they have stubborn cycle (like I do lol).
22311,So my period started on Aug 26th and ended on the 30th.
22312,"On the last day of my period,  i put the patch and stick it on my lower back."
22313,This is the first time in my life that I used birth control.
22314,I have regular periods and i used this for contraceptives.
22315,"Today, i decided to fully read the instructions (dumb i know) and i found out that you're supposed to stick on the first day of your period!!!!!!!!!"
22316,Is this gonna mess up my flow or something?

22321,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
22322,You can start it at any time!
22323,"If you start it during the first 5 days of your period, its effective immediately otherwise, its effective after 7 full days."
22324,Thats the only difference.
22325,It wont mess up your cycle because you dont have a cycle while on combination birth control  it works by stopping your cycle to stop ovulation.
22326,"Just to add, I just started Xulane, Im about to start my 4th week tomorrow."
22327,"Thats the week I dont wear a patch, while it does stop your cycle (ovulation), you will likely still get your period during the off patch week, itll be lighter and more manageable though."
22328,"However, it may take a few months for your body to adjust accordingly."
22329,"But as the person above said, youre all good."
22330,"And if you put the patch on the last day of your period Aug 30th, you should be protected by this point."
22331,"Lastly, I couldnt put on patch on the first day of my period because I switched from the Depo shot to the patch and the Depo shot took away my period entirely."
22332,I hope this word vomit makes sense and is at least somewhat helpful!
22333,!
22334,"Hi all, just wondering if anyone else has experienced their cycles getting longer using the copper IUD?I have heard of longer periods (doesnt apply to me now that i have had it for 8 months), but my cycle length just keeps getting longer and longer (currently on day 35 of my cycle still waiting for my period)."
22335,Before people ask  I have done a pregnancy test.Keen to hear other peoples experiences!
22336,Yes I have the same experience!
22337,"I got the copper IUD a little over a yea ago, it made my period heavier, but also shorter its only 34 days of heavy bleeding compared to 7 days before IUD of light bleeding."
22338,But my cycle went from 30 days exactly every month to now 38!
22339,I have even had a 42 day cycle twice.

22349,Can I ask if your cramps feel any different with an IUD inserted?
22350,I just get more gas cramps now but thats because i didnt get gas when i was on hormones
22351,Yes they changed and feel much stronger.
22352,"I only get them the 3 days before my period now, they arent as frequent as before I got my IUD but they are much much stronger."
22353,"I double over sometimes when I get them,  but they are brief and they only happen the first three days before my period and the day that I get it the cramps stop oddly enough."
22354,"Before IUD, I had cramps before, and during the first 4 days of period."
22355,Anyone have experience with microgestin?
22356,Just so you know birth control side effects are extremely personal.

22366,I had cramping and a medium flow but just to be safe i took a pregnancy test.
22367,this morning it was negative but i checked again just now after about 9 hours and theres a faint line (clear blue test).
22368,could i be pregnant?

22401,This was my case on both the implant and now on Slynd.
22402,I found it never really evened out or became predictable but it was still better than when I wasn't on anything and was going through a pack of pads a day and anemic.
22403,I'd say give it maybe another cycle or two for it to mellow out some.
22404,"Mine were never regular, but there were at least lighter."

22431,So i expelled my iud and now im looking for other forms of birth control.
22432,I swore off of hormones but after looking at FAM and realizing id probably mess up and get pregnant im reconsidering that stance.
22433,Im terrified of possible side effects of the minipill so im asking what you guys experiences have been like.
22434,Thank you to anyone who shares.

22436,hi i just started cerazette about two weeks ago and was terrified of what it would do to my anxiety but ive had absolutely minimal side affects from it !!
22437,if anything im just a little bit more emotional but nothing crazy!
22438,Hi!
22439,"I started Lyleq a month ago and I havent experienced anything like mood swings, nausea, headaches or increased appetite."
22440,Maybe a slight headache for the first few days but nothing that actually hindered my daily life.
22441,The only thing Im experiencing right now is constant spotting accompanied with some cramps.
22442,"It isnt heavy bleeding, just when I wipe theres a small amount of brown discharge/dark blood."
22443,It stops for a few days and then starts again.
22444,I asked my NP about it and she said this is super common for the mini pill and I need to give it 3 months to see if my body regulates.
22445,Its super fucking annoying though lol so I started taking evening primrose oil (EPO) 2000mg just yesterday and 2000mg this morning so Im hoping thatll stop the spotting if I take it consistently  but not sure how itll go.
22446,I know theres an Ibuprofen trick people can use to stop spotting but I have to avoid taking a lot of Ibuprofen due to some other meds Im taking ) Let me know if you have any questions!!

22465,"How has it been for you?To add, unfortunately the only options in my country for birth control right now are condoms (which I religiously use and will continue to do so, whether on the pill or not) and the pill."
22466,Doctors won't put IUDs in anyone who hasn't given birth (I know that they can used by nulliparous people but oh well).
22467,I would get my tubes tied but no doctor would agree with me on that here either.
22468,Thanks!
22469,The traditional mini pill doesnt pose an increased risk!

22481,"If I just stop taking the pill, will the breakthrough bleeding stop?"
22482,"I'm not sexually active, so pregnancy wouldn't be an issue."
22483,I also heard you can stop the active pills for 4 days to stop the breakthrough bleeding and then start them again and no longer have breakthrough bleeding.
22484,"Yes, you can stop taking them now!"
22485,A withdrawal bleed does typically help stop breakthrough bleeding.
22486,"Because youre not sexually active and you dont need to worry about pregnancy, you can take breaks whenever."
22487,"In case anyone whos sexually active has the same question if you were sexually active, youd still be able to take a break now."

22501,"Take your next pill at your usual time and youll be fine, if its a combo pill."
22502,For future reference the combo pill has a 12 hour window to be taken.
22503,Its good to take it around the same time for ruitine so you get use to it and are taking it reliably every day.
22504,But the exact same time isnt a must!
22505,You missed one and took it as soon as you remembered which is exactly what ur ment to do.
22506,If you miss one just take it when you remember and take ur one for that day when you normaly do.
22507,In this case its also fine to take two in one day at the same time.
22508,Ur technically still protected unless you miss two pills

22517,"I got my mirena placed on August 8th and my doctor told me i could continue having sex without condoms august 26th which was two weeks after my mirena was inserted, strings are fine and doctor has continuously looked at it and said it actually looks perfect."
22518,should i be worried?
22519,was i supposed to use condoms?
22520,Its absolutely fine to use the IUD alone!

22531,Been taking it continuosly.
22532,Didnt have sex until 12th day of pills and I finished themOn Sept 6.
22533,I already took Plan B just to be safe and wont have sex anymore.

22540,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
22541,I just want to clarify a couple things1.
22542,Did you start the 18pill pack immediately after you finished a 21pill pack?
22543,Or did you do a break week before starting the 18pill pack?2.
22544,When is the most recent day you had sex?
22545,I did a break.
22546,I actually did because had been taking bc skipping last 7 days so preventing a period so I started spotting and it was because I was not letting my body start a period.
22547,I would start a new pack immediatelyLast pill on 6thx Had sex on the 8th and last night I took plan B
22548,"Yeah, then you werent protected from pregnancy on the 8th (unless you used condoms)."
22549,Youre only protected during a break if you take at least 21 consecutive active pills immediately before the break and at least 7 consecutive active pills after.
22550,Taking plan b was the right thing to do!
22551,A negative test is definitive 21 days after sex.
22552,Do you think it will help even more that today I start new birth control pack?
22553,Asides from plan B.
22554,As I said I wont plan on having sex anymore for a while.
22555,"Starting a new pack ASAP would likely help, though Im not sure how much."
22556,Youll be fully protected again when its time to take the 8th pill in your new back.
22557,"Btw, dont be alarmed if you have irregular bleeding, including a missed/ late period."
22558,Thats a very common side effect of plan b!
22559,Thank you so much!

22600,If pregnancy causes a rise in progesterone which prevents withdrawal bleeding.
22601,Why do people say that withdrawal bleeding isn't a way to assume that you aren't pregnant.
22602,Several reputable websites have also said that withdrawal bleeding means that you aren't pregnant
22603,Because you can still bleed lightly while pregnant and withdrawal bleeds are typically lighter then regular periods.ETA If youre comfortable trusting your withdrawal bleed as a sign you arent pregnant then go right ahead.

22623,Is there anything additional I should be doing to prevent post pill acne?
22624,Thank you x100!
22625,That all sounds great!

22673,Im going to be honest here Ive had a few different kinds of BC pills like Sronyx and Lutera.
22674,Vienva has been by far the WORST oral contraceptive Ive ever taken.
22675,It makes me bleed irregularly when I used to be exactly on the 28day cycle with my other BC.
22676,Its made me break out terribly and my mood swings have been terrible.
22677,Ive been on it for longer than 6 months as I was hoping it would improve.
22678,Nothing has changed for me.
22679,I had an appointment with my Gyno recently to get a different type of BC pill.
22680,Im hoping this new one works better for me.
22681,"And Im terms of switching, its completely your call."
22682,Im not sure if youve had the pill in the past but usually my body adjusts by 23 months if not much sooner.
22683,You know your body the best.
22684,I would suggest switching but Im biased because Ive had such a bad experience with Vienva.
22685,Ive just been prescribe lucette pill for my irregular periods ( and never want to get pregnant either).

22693,So I posted my tale of woe a few days ago about my copper IUD expelling (for the second time) and this is kind of a follow up to that.
22694,I got it removed but I just realized that me and my bf had sexwhile it was out of placeand I was ovulating.
22695,So could I be pregnant?
22696,The IUD was still in me just sitting a little low.
22697,Technically we didnt have sex the exact day I ovulated but two days before.
22698,We also had sex today but from what I understand its alright since I ovulated days ago.
22699,Is that right?
22700,I really should look into FAM
22701,"Unless youre properly tracking ovulation through temps, you cant know when youre ovulating."
22702,If your IUD was out of place then yes you can get pregnant.
22703,"If your IUD is still out, you need to take emergency contraception for sex today if you dont want to get pregnant."
22704,That or tried to get an IUD placed again within 5 days.
22705,Youll need to test 23 weeks after both instances of sex and you need to use condoms until you get back on birth control.
22706,"Possibly, yes, you could be pregnant."
22707,A test two weeks after sex should be accurate but three weeks after sex is best.
22708,Is it too late to take a PlanB?
22709,Since your body already expelled 2 IUDs I really don't know if that's a good EC option for you.

22715,Crap.
22716,Thanks for the info.
22717,I track ovulation via cervical mucus/test strips so I generally know when I am.
22718,The only way to actually confirm ovulation is by tracking your basal body temp along with those.
22719,Two days before ovulation has one of the highest chances of getting pregnant with around a 2030 chance.
22720,But like I said without proper tracking theres no way to know.
22721,I would take emergency contraception.
22722,"If youre wanting to truly do FAM, r/famnnfp is a good place to start."
22723,So I went to an amusement park with a date of sorts yesterday and we wound up having sex.
22724,The condom slipped off as he was pulling out after finishing and I wound up having a mess inside.
22725,I only just started birth control and dont know how effective it is yet.
22726,"We wound up riding rides for the rest of the day, bc the park doesnt allow you to come back in after you leave even if you have proof of tickets."
22727,"It was late and I wound up falling asleep before I could buy day after medicine, but money is pretty tight after that trip."
22728,"My period ending less than a week ago, and as much as I would prefer to just drop 50 on day after, is it possible me that the coasters could have helped prevent fertilization?"
22729,Im probably going to get the Plan B anyways but Im just curious.
22730,"I rode a ton of high speed ones and after I started to go to a drug store, I had to wonder what my actual odds of getting pregnant are right now."
22731,Have you been on birth control 7 full days?
22732,If so then youre fine.
22733,A roller coaster would have no effect on that.
22734,If you havent been then you need plan b
22735,If youve been on the pill for 7 days (8th pill) you are protected from pregnancy.
22736,"And to answer your questions about roller coasters and the sperm, well you gave them a ride too, hopefully the little fellas enjoyed the ride, but thats not gonna stop them from trying to do their job."
22737,But once again as long as its been 7 days or if you started the pill on the first 5 days of your period you are fine.

22765,Set your limits and stick to them.
22766,"For example, ""If I'm bleeding/spotting more than 30 of the days in one month I'll make an appointment to discuss with my doctor"" or ""If severe cramping doesn't stop by six months I'll get it removed."""
22767,And take emotional side effects seriously  it can be life threatening.

22779,"The unbearable cramping sounds more worrying (in that its unbearable, which sounds quite strong) so I dont know if thats worth asking your doctor about."
22780,Good for you calling for an appointment about the pain.
22781,"If you were my friend I would ask you to insist on an urgent appointment as soon as possible, and emphasise that the pain seems stronger than it should be."
22782,Your pain is real and it should not be killing you.
22783,"To avoid fear of not being taken seriously, you can tell doctors objective / observable things like its affecting your daily life, you have to pause or stop what youre doing because of the pain.Just to add that where I live, going to the hospital (emergency) would be something I personally would consider if the pain was very bad."
22784,"That makes sense, thank you!"
22785,!
22786,I really appreciate this!
22787,Pre IUD I never had cramps and don't know what's normal or what might be considered normal but I know for sure this isn't and if it is it shouldn't be.
22788,My boyfriend also told me to insist that I was in debilitating pain when making the appointment
22789,Hi all.
22790,I was on generic yaz for about 15 years total.
22791,I never had any bad side effects or anything from it.
22792,I went off in November 2022 at 28 years old.
22793,Since then.. my body has been a disaster.
22794,I am extremely active.
22795,( CrossFit 23 times a week weight lifting 23 times a week and walking every day ) I eat a high protein healthy diet.
22796,I do eat bullshit every now and then and drink every now and then but thats never effected my weight before.. since November 2022 I have packed on 30 pounds.
22797,I cannot lose this weight.
22798,Ive tracked calories and workouts tirelessly.
22799,Since I saw my dr last in April 2022 I have gained 15 pounds.. my face is also awful I have acne ( horrible cystic ) everywhere that I cannot get rid of.
22800,Differin and benzoyl peroxide havent been able to touch it.
22801,Im all oily and greasy again like a teenager.
22802,My hair has been thinning for awhile.
22803,I went to the dr today and he did some hormonal blood work on me turns out my testosterone is elevated.
22804,The reading is 42 ( normal is 835 according to health care website .)
22805,has anyone else experienced anything like this?This whole experience has been so embarrassing and traumatic.
22806,I feel so disgusting / my dr prescribed spironolactone 25mg once a day for now to help with acne.
22807,Any ranting or feedback is helpful please
22808,My testosterone was high coming off too!
22809,Not uncommon.
22810,I hope the Spiro works for you.
22811,Mine was not too high so I started a supplement to lower it.
22812,A lot of gals drink spearmint tea as a natural way to help lower T.

22826,I have been taking Levest for 2 months.
22827,I received a fairly normal withdrawal bleed after my first pack however 2 days before finishing my second pack I had some breakthrough bleeding which continued into the following week of not taking any pills.
22828,This therefore has made it difficult to determine when my withdrawal bleed started?Breakthrough bleeding started on Friday and  stopped around Wednesday but was quite heavy.
22829,I stopped taking pills on Sunday.
22830,"On Thursday I had some very very light light bleeding, pink and some brown and by Friday it had stopped."
22831,Is there a chance this could have been my withdrawal bleed yet significantly light?
22832,Im feeling anxious as I take my pills within 15 minutes each day and have never missed one.
22833,We also use the pull out method.
22834,Has this happened to anyone before or is this normal?

22842,So I was talking to someone who has a history of DVTs and her doctor put her on Slynd well her OB.
22843,She apparently ended up getting another DVT and all the other doctors she seen said to immediately get off of Slynd and that it is not good for a history of blood clots.
22844,I am so confused?
22845,My doctor told me it was basically for people that had a history of them?

22850,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
22851,Usually if you clot again on any hormonal method they are going to say to discontinue it (and likely all hormones) not necessarily because there is for sure an established link but it is no longer worth the risk given that individual's clotting history.
22852,"I am on Slynd postclot (CVST instead of DVT, but provoked by estrogen birth control) approved by my neurologist and PCP."
22853,But I have no doubt if I had a repeat clotting event the next step would be no hormones along with blood thinners for life most likely.
22854,It's all about weighing the risks and benefits and making the best decision for that particular patient.
22855,Im on MonoLinyah the combination pill and I had a late pill (16 hours late).
22856,I took it as soon as I remembered and then the one for that day also.

22858,I usually take my pack continuously for 3 full packs.
22859,Im currently on my second pack and I have about 5 active pills left in it.
22860,Did having a late pill make me unprotected now?
22861,"If I have unprotected sex, do I need a back up method?"

22871,Im on my second pack of Errin after switching from the combo pill.
22872,I had my period Aug 25 Sept 1.
22873,Fast forward to this morning and Im having breakthrough bleeding.
22874,It seems to be looking like a light/average period.
22875,I was reading you can take 2 mini pills to help stop break through bleeding.
22876,Is this true?
22877,Is it okay specifically with Errin?

22898,thanks so much this is great to hear  this situation is definitely encouraging me to stay consistent with the time i take it.
22899,so i am an idiot and went to take my loloestrin pill at the gym and the tiny sucker rolled away into the lockers with no way to get it out.
22900,"In a rush I took the pill for tomorrow, Im debating do I just skip the pill for tomorrow to stay on track or do i take the rest and change my birth control start day??"
22901,Im on my 3rd row and about to start my last so if i skip i dont it might effect me much?
22902,not worried about sex just more worried about my body because my body is so sensitive that sometimes that i dont take my pill on time every day i breakthrough bleed for weeks but that usually happens in my 3rd row and ive successfully made it past that!

22923,"Vcf is a spermicide, and Ive chosen the film version."
22924,"It says to insert it against the cervix and wait 15min, what happens if you dont wait the time?"
22925,And is it effective at all if its not near the cervix?
22926,Its so hard to find details online explaining how it works and what makes it less effective or completely ineffective!
22927,Do keep in mind spermicide alone is already not very effective.
22928,"Unfortunately, user error is part of the issue."
22929,You need to try to insert it correctly so it wont just fall out.
22930,You do also need to wait the specified timeframe.
22931,"If you dont wait the film wont dissolve into a gel, meaning it wont be effective."
22932,"Spermicide is designed to be used alongside barriers, such as condoms or cervical caps."
22933,Its also not a bad idea to patch test both you and your partner as it can be very irritating.

22939,Your man is gonna have a tiny square on his dick and then you gotta go buy a plan b.
22940,But as the other poster said they arent really effective on their own.
22941,I didnt get pregnant from my experience but you asked what happens if you dont wait out the time.
22942,Oh my gosh thats crazy!!!
22943,I didnt think itd stick to him like that!
22944,"I thought I waited long enough, even set a timer and apparently not lol."
22945,Like it was at least something to laugh about later when nerves weren't high
22946,Thats just crazy!
22947,"So, I got an IUD placed yesterday afternoon after about 7 years on the combo pill and I wanted to share my good experience here as you see a lot of horror stories online."
22948,I was just tired of taking a pill every day and had been wanting an IUD for years but was terrified from reading all the horrible experiences people seem to have with insertion regarding the pain.
22949,"But my insurance recently stopped covering my pill so I figured fuck it, nows the time."
22950,And I would absolutely do it again!
22951,"My doctor was very kind and patient, answered any and all questions I had during my consult and at my actual insertion appointment yesterday."
22952,She informed me of what she was doing each step of the way and guided me through breathing techniques for the pain.
22953,I didnt get any kind of painkillers or numbing (just took Advil 1 hour before) and it was bearable.
22954,"It felt like a bad cramp when she measured my uterus, and then a slightly worse cramp when she inserted, but then it was over in less than 90 seconds!"
22955,And I will say Ive had period cramps worse than that in my life.
22956,"Then I went home and had some pretty bad cramping that evening, but again nothing unbearable."
22957,And as of waking up this morning Ive been perfectly fine!
22958,"Literally feels like nothing happened, just having a small bit of spotting (a liner is doing the job just fine, no need for a full pad)."
22959,"So, I just wanted to share my positive experience for those out there considering getting and IUD but are scared because you think everyone has a terrible experience with it."
22960,"Of course every person is different and Im not diminishing the pain that some women do feel, but just know that thats not always the case and people are more likely to share when something bad happened versus a normal/good experience."
22961,Im really starting to think its dr dependent.
22962,I had IUDs placed after kids that were painless and one ten years after that hurt A LOT I dont know if it was the dr or that I was still healing from birth but I was shocked that the last time sucked so bad..

22973,I dont on mine everyone is different and some do and some dont.
22974,My doctor and the internet says to wait three months for your hormones to even out after starting a new birth control.
22975,"After three months, bad side effects could get better."
22976,Is this even true??
22977,Im one month on norethindrone and im so depressed and ready to give up.
22978,Are we just supposed to suffer for three months before switching birth control and then suffer again on the new one?
22979,Has anyone actually felt better after three months?
22980,36 months.
22981,I was testing out birth control side effects for 3 straight years and was just prescribed a new one and could not stand the thought of doing it all over again.
22982,Id rather fight for a diagnosis (probably endometriosis) and get a hysterectomy or excision surgery.
22983,I knew after one month that my first pill prescription did NOT work.
22984,I suddenly got forehead acne and it was getting worse.
22985,I told my doctor to change it immediately and I was fine after that.
22986,I changed again this year and it took over 6 months to level out and feel like my old self.
22987,"At exactly the 6th month mark on the pill, all side effects subsided and everything regulated."
22988,Sometimes some will occasionally pop up every pack or two but otherwise everything truly did level out for me after 36 months.
22989,Im so sorry your experience has been like this thus far!!!
22990,"I want to tell you to hold on, then see."
22991,"But if it is so bad that you cannot function I would say to speak to you doctor about it.My (25F) experience was very good, in all honesty."
22992,I am currently on a low dose combo pill and on my third month and I am having a good time.
22993,"But it came with some waiting.Without my pill, I had daily nausea, bloating, fatigue, and 7 day crimson tides that came with debilitating daystopping cramps."
22994,"Good days where I didnt have stomach problems or hot flashes were spotty.On my first month on the pill, everything ""shifted"" in a way."
22995,"I felt better, and also worse?"
22996,"I had lessened nausea, no hot flashes, but I also gained bad acne, recurring migraines, mood swings towards anger, hunger, and cramps up the butt I have never felt in all the years I had lived to then."
22997,"I had also become more constipated.On my second month, those lessened."
22998,"And all I was left with were the migraines, really tender breasts, and cramps."
22999,I also had fluctuating bowels and GI issues which were a cause for stress for me.
23000,"I am on my third month now, and I can say getting those side effects are only every now and again."
23001,The only thing that has remained persistent are my sore chesticles.
23002,"I am considering asking my doctor if I could just continue this method, instead of stopping as per her instructions two months back.This is only my experience, however, I hope it helps!"
23003,It is really hard and sucks we have to wait so long to see what works.
23004,And I am so lucky that I do not have a bad experience with hormones.
23005,"Yes, its true!"
23006,"They typically improve after the first 36 months, though the 3 month mark is usually when doctors recommend switching if side effects are still an issue (I think because for the majority of people, if its still a problem after 3 months, the likelihood of improvement is pretty low)."
23007,"How long youre willing to wait is entirely up to you though!That said  if you have severe side effects (such as suicidal thoughts) at any time, stop immediately."
23008,"If its making you feel depressed, i think you should try something else."
23009,The three month period of adjustment shouldnt be unbearable.
23010,I have preexisting depression and anxiety and all of the other birth controls Ive tried have made it so bad even if i was doing okay.
23011,I couldnt stick it out for 3 months.Now im taking lo loestrin and im halfway through the third pack.
23012,"Yes there has been adjustment, but it hasnt made me depressed."
23013,"It has mainly been physical symptoms, spotting, occasional mood swings that may not even be from the pill, etc."
23014,"I think that when doctors and people say that there is a three month adjustment period, it is in regards to mild symptoms."

23025,Ive had my IUD about 4 months.
23026,I had pretty minimal side effects to begin with but even those did indeed taper off at about the 3 month mark.
23027,yeah it's definitely true in my case.
23028,I'm on Diane 35 and it was extremely debilitating the first 3 months.
23029,I'm on month 5 and it's gotten a lot better mentally.
23030,"ive been on nexplanon for a little over a year now  and it took around 6 months for my periods to stop,, the first month of it i probably lost like 10lbs but i quickly leveled back out bc hormones,, uhhm it took 6 months for my arm to stop hurting and be usable.,."
23031,"thats about it tho, i didnt get any side effects mentally or anything i think it actually made me more positive especially when my periods stopped."
23032,"unfortunately hormonal birth control is just like that it can worsen ur mental state or completely change it for the positive., u might have to wait it out and talk to ur doctor about it unfortunately  good luck!"
23033,!
23034,I bled all 3 years with nexplanon every single day so it just depends on your body and then they wouldn't take it out during COVID.
23035,I just had it taken out last year and replaced with an IUD(which I love)
23036,"For me, it is, I've been on nexplanon for almost two months now, and I'd say most of the side effects have already disappeared or are slowly subsiding"
23037,I found my body fluctuated a lot in the first few months.
23038,But some side effects wont be worth waiting out.
23039,"If you feel unsure, it would be worth waiting but you cant stop anytime so if its awful, just stop it."
23040,did u have cramps during active pills?
23041,mine are so bad and im scared
23042,Yes I did!!!
23043,It is sporadic now!
23044,But it hurts like a twisted ovary or grabbed uterus whenever it does ((
23045,My 22 yo gf is debating to get an copper iud.
23046,We both want to do creampies during sex.
23047,"She seems to trust the iud completely, while im still on the fence about its effectiveness."
23048,"She told me if we use condom, then there is no point of her to get an IUD in the first place."
23049,"It looks like she gets sad when I bring up the topic of condomsiud((, but I am all for two contraceptive methods, because we are not in a position to take care of a child right now."
23050,"However, we both want to have kid together in the future.In order to satisfy both of us I started tracking her fertility and her basal body temp."
23051,She agrees that we will do creampie on her non fertile days and wear condoms during her ovulation.
23052,Im thinking of picking up ovulation test kit to verify her fertility more accurately.
23053,Why I havent seen this method as a combined contraceptive method for non hormonal options?
23054,Can someone please enlighten me?
23055,Just do pull out along with the copper iud.
23056,Ovulation tests are very very very hard to use.
23057,She would need to almost take them daily.
23058,Ovulation tests generally have two lines and you track over the month how dark the second line is.
23059,It is unlikely you as a couple would take a ovulation test almost daily for years.
23060,I had an IUD for 10 years and had no issues with cream pies during the time.
23061,If you're that worried you can save it for special occasions and keep pregnancy tests on hand.
23062,You said in a previous post youre long distance.
23063,How are you tracking her basal body temp daily and how to you expect to track using OPKs?
23064,Theyre meant be be taken preferably twice a day every day.
23065,This just sounds like something shed be responsible for on top of having an IUD.
23066,The IUD is extremely effective on its own.
23067,"But if youre not comfortable with that, youre not comfortable and she needs to respect that."
23068,I have Nexplanon which is the most effective birth control out there and my partner prefers to still wear a condom.
23069,I dont mind because it makes him feel better.
23070,Sounds like the best compromise is for you to either pull out or just wear a condom.
23071,IUDs are statistically more effective than sterilization.
23072,I relied solely on an IUD as birth control for 6 years without a single scare or concern (I still have one but Im sterilized now as well).
23073,Clear blue has an OPK kit that is very easy to use and claim that they are over 99 effective in detecting ovulation.
23074,Im tempted to try this in combination to tracking her periods and basal body temp.
23075,Do you think these things will make it easier?
23076,Shes tracking her temperature on her own when waking up and we do the charts together.
23077,Im thinking of using OPK to rather confirm ovulation windows and avoid having no condom sex then.
23078,"If theres no eggs then creampie away lol.If anything, i think this doesnt cause any harm and Im learning about her fertility."
23079,Im not sure why some people in this post are upset about my approach to FAM.
23080,If it is only 0.1 different thats also great.
23081,I rather be active in prevention and understand how fertility works than trusting the device solely.
23082,My girlfriend appreciates and enjoys that we are learning this together.
23083,I just wanna to see if someone else is also doing it and give me some insights.
23084,Is she willing to take a test daily?
23085,Using temps to track is way more accurate than using OPKs but you can pair them together.
23086,But what Im saying is that you arent the one doing it.
23087,Shes the one who has to temp and shes the one who has to take the tests.
23088,The way your post came across is that she doesnt respect your wanting to be extra cautious.
23089,If shes fine with doing all this then thats great!
23090,Its good that youre involved but ultimately its more for her to do.
23091,Many people rely solely on FAM.
23092,You can check out r/famnnfp for advice tailored to fertility awareness methods.
23093,ETA I saw you said shes only willing to test during her ovulation window.
23094,Thats not effective because the whole point of ovulation tracking is knowing when the window is.
23095,She has to take them daily.
23096,No only during ovulation windows
23097,How would she know her ovulation window?
23098,Calendar only method is the least effective method available.
23099,"There are apps that track your cycle based on your periods, basal body temp, cervical mucus."
23100,"The more info you give it the more accurate it is, but im not doing all of them lol."
23101,The OPK can confirm when exactly she ovulates
23102,"Unless she does daily temperature (alcohol impacts temperature, as well as not sleeping well) and daily cervical mucus checks, she is guessing at her ovulation window.Total guess in the dark."
23103,I am starting birth control (specifically the generic for Yaz) in an attempt to treat my PMDD.
23104,Im only a couple days in and I feel great except for some nausea and pretty bad heartburn.
23105,The nausea is mild but the heartburn SUCKS.
23106,Ive taken it with food and that doesnt seem to make much difference.
23107,I really want to give this a chance because Ive been having such a hard time dealing with PMDD and awful periods.
23108,I know it doesnt work for everyone but Im desperate enough to try anything and am hoping for the best.
23109,My question is Has anyone else experienced nasty heartburn when starting birth control?
23110,Did it go away as you got used to it?
23111,"If not, how do you deal with it?"

23117,Ive been on BC for 3 years and my libido dropped to almost non existence.
23118,"Most of the time, I just have sex with my partner to give him pleasure."
23119,Maybe once every two weeks do I actually get somewhat horny.Its always a struggle for me to get wet.
23120,Either we just use coconut oil or we continuously use our spit as lube.
23121,"My clitoris either feels desensitized or too sensitive.Recently, I had a sudden short window (10 days) where it felt like my libido was back to a normal."
23122,I was able to get horny everyday and crave my partner every single day.
23123,"I would instantly get naturally lubricated by foreplay and my clitoris actually felt good sensations.But out of nowhere, it stopped."
23124,And I feel devastated.
23125,I loved having that libido bounce back.
23126,Now getting to experience a normal libido but not anymore makes it so sexually frustrating to me.Do I really have to get off BC to be able to experience this again?

23134,Hi everyone!
23135,I am a 20F and have been on birth control for the past 6 months.
23136,I am on junel fe 1/20 (first bc ever).
23137,"I mainly to prevent pregnancy, help skin, and relieve cramps."
23138,Everything was fine until recently.
23139,When starting I had very minimal symptoms that went away after three months.
23140,The month of July I had a terrible headache and bad constipation.
23141,"When it came to my period week I had no bleeding, nothing."
23142,This was my fourth month on it.
23143,I was fully convinced I was pregnant due to the terrible symptoms I was having.
23144,But I took a test and negative.
23145,"I started my pills as normal, then the headache came back and was followed with a lot of dizziness."
23146,It was awful.
23147,I got my period the last week of august and felt so much better.
23148,Until this week.
23149,"I started taking the pills again and got hit with the worst headache, nausea, dizziness."
23150,Way worst than the first time.
23151,Something feels so off with my body so Im stopping tonight.
23152,Does anyone have any tips on what to expect?
23153,Im a little scared but anything would be better than this.

23168,I took my pill 1 1/2 hours late.
23169,I have Loestrin am I okay?
23170,1 1/2 hours late doesnt pose a risk.

23177,I think youre fine.
23178,I eventually stopped bleeding on lolo.
23179,Just take a pregnancy test once a month if that happens.
23180,I went to use the bathroom last night and i saw a little bit of blood.
23181,This is the first time im taking BC
23182,Yeah.
23183,Spotting on lolo is also very common.
23184,I shouldnt worry right?
23185,I should be fine?
23186,Cause i was thinking of getting a plan B just in case I really cant have a kid
23187,Youre fine.
23188,Spotting on lolo is normal.
23189,I bled for an entire year on lolo.
23190,Then it slowly stopped.
23191,"The chance of pregnancy is not 0, so if you absolutely cannot get pregnant then use condoms with it.Plan b only works BEFORE ovulation because it works by preventing ovulation."
23192,Which is what your bc is doing.
23193,"Its meant to be taken if you had actual unprotected sex, which you didnt."
23194,Youll have more side effects if you do that.
23195,Yeah thats what I do but he just so happened to not have it and i told him to pull out cause bc isnt 100 but he thought otherwise and accidentally just did it.
23196,Oh you are fine.
23197,Dont trust him to just be able to pull out from now on though.
23198,Thank you
23199,"Also lolo is a low dose combo pill, taking it an hour and a half late isnt really late but since its so low dose it is good to stay as close to the time as you can )"

23208,You are having protected sex
23209, THANK YOU!
23210,Im wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience or has any insights.
23211,About 18 months ago I (26 F) got my bilateral salpingectomy (tube removal).
23212,Elective procedure and one of the reasons was so I could get off of hormonal BC.
23213,"However, Ive now been off of BC for more than a year and my depression is the worst Ive ever experienced."
23214,"My meds that were working for years stopped working, no new meds seem to be working, my PMS irritation is off the charts and Im barely functioning day to day."
23215,"I know a lot of people complain of mood issues while on hormonal birth control and I never experienced those, but has anyone experienced severe negative mood changes after going OFF of it?"
23216,"I was on the pill starting at 14 up until I was about 19, and then on the nexplanon implant after that for just under 6 years."
23217,I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for over about 78 years for both.
23218,Im just wondering if anyone else has experienced similar.
23219,"Im afraid to bring it up to my doctor because all of the literature seems to point toward going ON hormonal birth control causing bad mood changes, not being off of it."
23220,I hoped things would regulate but Ive had my implant out for 14 months now.
23221,Its certainly possible that birth control stabilizing your hormones helped with your depression!
23222,Dont be afraid to bring it up with your doctor  its relevant to your health
23223,I would ask for a hormone panel.
23224,I was never depressed a day in my life until I came off hbc.
23225,I've been feeling a lot better since I started taking bio progesterone pills after my hormone testing revealed estrogen dominance.

23231,"I have a history of anxiety and depression and CPTSD, I also have ADHD and may possibly be on the autism spectrum."
23232,For the past couple months my anxiety and depression have been at a minimum until recently.
23233,"I started using the Xulane patch about a month ago, it was working fine but in the past week I noticed heightened anxiety/CPTSD triggers making my mind spiral into dark places and I feel like all my mental health progress went out the window."
23234,I took the patch off yesterday because this is my off week and I suddenly made the connection that the patch is probably causing this mental turmoil.
23235,It makes me feel relieved that its just the birth control and Im not going insane.
23236,"I feel a lot better right now without the patch, but does the emotional stuff get better?"
23237,I dont have any symptoms or side effects besides this and mild headaches that are tolerable without painkillers.
23238,I really want this patch to work out.
23239,I dont want an IUD or nexplanon bc I dont like the idea of something being stuck in me and needing a doctor to take it out.
23240,I hear awful things about depo so thats a definite no.
23241,"I took the pill for years before taking a break, then going back on it in 2021 and it gave me insane clots."
23242,Also having ADHD and a varying schedule each day its hard to remember to take a pill every day at the same time.
23243,"My periods are awful, and dare I say, handicapping without BC."

23249,"Hi, if the patch is causing those kinds of side effects it doesn't sound worth the risk to try it again."
23250,They may go away after the adjustment period or they may not and it will take months to figure it out.
23251,Can you try the mini pill?
23252,No estrogen which helps with the clotting concerns.
23253,Im about to start xulane next week once I get my period but my doctor also mentioned maybe trying the nuvaring?
23254,I guess the patch and the ring both have the least metabolism change for adhd meds compared to the pill so I figured I might try that if the patch doesnt work out.
23255,"I know you mentioned not wanting things stuck inside you with doctor removal only, so the ring might be a good middle of the road?"
23256,"You have control over that to take it in and out yourself at least?Side note for if you ever do decide on an iud  I had the paragard iud for over 5 years and while it was effective and nonhormonal which I liked at the time, the cramping and heavy periods never seemed to go away, and I always had spotting too."
23257,As soon as it was gone it seemed like my body felt so much better.
23258,Thank you for the advice!
23259,Im still on the patch and doing better now but if the symptoms come back Ill definitely look into the ring
23260,Upset.
23261,Could be normal but hate this anyway.

23270,"Breakthrough bleeding can happen when using birth control, especially if you just got on it."
23271,It takes a bit to adjust to the hormones that are being added to your body and thats sadly how the body reacts sometimes.
23272,For me I bled for about two weeks when I first got on birth control but it eventually sorted itself out.
23273,Usually the placebo week gives it time to sort itself out.
23274,If it is consistent heavy bleeding see your doctor and discuss options with them.
23275,My partner and I had sex 3 times yesterday which happened to be the day I was ovulating.
23276,"I told him he could finish in me and that I would take a plan B, which I did today."
23277,I was looking up the side effects of plan B and came across some controversy over whether or not Plan B works after/ during ovulation.
23278,"According to a few different websites, it does not."
23279,"I know, I should have looked it up before making these decisions, but here we are."
23280,Does anyone know if this is true/ has anyone had a similar experience?
23281,Plan B does not work during or after ovulation.
23282,"If you are ovulating, Plan B will not work but unless youre tracking properly there is no way to know if you are indeed ovulating."
23283,r/planbsA test is accurate two weeks after sex and definitive after three.
23284,Use condoms if you dont want to get pregnant.
23285,Plan B is not birth control.
23286,Plan B does not work during or after ovulation.
23287,It works by delaying ovulation.
23288,A test is definitive 21 days after sex.
23289,How are you tracking ovulation?
23290,Period apps are not accurate.
23291,"Unfortunately, if you did ovulate already Plan B will have little to no effect."
23292,"If you want to lower your risk of pregnancy you can have an IUD (Paraguard, Mirena or Liletta) inserted within 5 days."
23293,They act as emergency contraception even if ovulation has occurred.
23294,Youll still need to take a pregnancy test 21 days from now.
23295,Please never again try to use Plan B as your Plan A.
23296,Withdrawal alone is also not sufficient contraception if youre trying to avoid pregnancy.
23297,"Use condoms or talk to your doctor about birth control options, especially if you dont get an IUD."
23298,This is one of the easiest ways to get pregnant  plan B does not work during ovulation.Test in 3 weeks to be sure.

23304,"Im 26, this is my first time using plan B."
23305,Definitely not using as birth control.
23306,I just wasnt aware that there are certain times it would work or not work.
23307,Thanks
23308,Thanks
23309,Ive been using hormonal strips.
23310,I definitely could be wrong about whether or not I ovulated.
23311,Thanks I appreciate the other information.
23312,"I am very against hormonal birth controls (for myself, not in general), and I did read that an IUD would definitely prevent a pregnancy within five days, but that seems a little extreme."
23313,Not a trap!
23314,We talked about it every step of the way.
23315,"He knows where Im at in my cycle and I gave him the option of me going and getting an iud as emergency contraception, but we decided to just wait and see."
23316,Why are you bothering to track ovulation if you're not going to use protection during that time?
23317,Condoms are free and widely accessible
23318,If you decided to have unprotected sex and said sure go for it Ill just take plan b after.
23319,Then that is using plan b as contraception!
23320,Dosnt do that its a bad idea and as you can see might not work!
23321,Its only ment as a emergency if ur plan A has failed
23322,You made a conscious decision to use plan b instead of any using any form birth control including a condom.
23323,"So yes you are using it as birth controlyour an adult, make the decision to protect yourself and have a plan A."
23324,"You did though, you made the conscious choice to not use protection and just pop an emergency contraceptive instead."
23325,"If you dont want to get pregnant, it is your responsibility to read up and educate yourself on contraceptives before putting yourself at risk."
23326,You do realize that plan B is a huge dose of hormones right?
23327,Its actually worst for you than regular hormonal contraceptive which is why its only EMERGENCY contraceptive.
23328,Like another commenter said this Plan B is going to send your body on much more of a hormonal roller coaster than the daily pill ever would.
23329,Plan B is like taking up to 5 days of the pill all at once.
23330,You can expect your cycle to be impacted for up to 3 months.
23331,You also cannot rely on any form of cycle tracking until 3 months has passed.
23332,If you and your partner are planning for pregnancy (or comfortable with that outcome) you can continue relying on withdrawal.
23333,"Considering you took EC, that doesnt seem to be the case."
23334,If you arent interested in hormonal contraception and dont want to get pregnant you need an actual Plan A.
23335,The copper IUD is one such option.
23336,"Theres always condoms and other forms of barriers (e.g., cervical caps, which should be used with a secondary method)."
23337,You could also look into reliable ovulation tracking once the 3 months has passed.
23338,Ovulation strips alone arent very helpful because sperm can survive for up to 5 days and they can be hard to read.
23339,r/FAMnNFP has some good information linked on the sidebar.
23340,Ive been tracking ovulation to have a clear grasp on what phase of my cycle Im in and to be aware of the hormonal changes in my body.
23341,"Well, plan A was him pulling out."
23342,"But one of the times seemed iffy, so I was going to take plan B anyway, which is what prompted me to say go for it."
23343,If you have a clear grasp of your cycle then you must know having unprotected sex during your ovulation period will end up in a pregnancy.
23344,You completely dodged my question btw.
23345,"I understand how women track their cycles, you're not doing it properly lol."
23346,"When ovulating, use protection or abstain."
23347,Don't use Plan B lol
23348,Pull out is not a safe plan a.
23349,You can get pregnant from precum dont use that as ur plan a find another way!
23350,This is not safe sex and do you want to have a risky sex life?
23351,Condoms or birth control is a plan A.

23353,"Long story short, I had an IUD inserted and stopped taking the pill a week ago because I hate the side effects I get from it."
23354,"Since then and especially the last couple days Ive been irritable, exhausted, big mood swings, suddenly feel like my partner has lost interest, randomly cryingyou name it."
23355,Ive never felt like this before and Im convinced its from my body coming down off the hormones.
23356,Has anyone else experienced this?
23357,If so how long did it last?

23364,"Yes, that's normal for coming off the pill."
23365,"It varies by person, could be a few weeks or a few months for things to settle a bit."
23366,"Take it easy, get a ton of rest, eat nutrient dense food and remember it's all because of the hormones."
23367,Eventually you'll laugh about it because you know you're being ridiculous.
23368,"Hi, Im F (21) and I want to get back onto the pill however I dont want my libido to lower and I already have cystic acne so I dont want to do too much to it."
23369,Is there any certain pill or hormones I should look for before choosing a pill?
23370,Open to all the suggestions
23371,"Really each pill is a case by case basis, what might work for me (junel fe 1/20) which is a low dose pill, might not work for you."
23372,And by not work I mean like you might have different side effect than I will.
23373,"I have also been on taytulla for a short period and gemmily which is the generic version of it, and on those I personally had no side effects on them, however they are on the pricey side if you do not have insurance."
23374,"But they worked for me pretty good, and I didnt feel much different"
23375,"Just let your doctor know what you are looking to get out of BC, and what side effects you are most concerned about, and they can help you narrow down your options and prioritize methods to try out."
23376,"There are certain hormones that are better at treating acne so you could try some of those first (like the pill Yaz) and see how it agrees with you, but like I said your doctor can narrow it down depending in your preferences."
23377,"It is mostly trial and error for what works best unfortunately, it is just that super individual."
23378,"Even what does or doesn't work for close relatives, like moms or sisters, doesn't mean it will be that way for you."
23379,"Best of luck, hope you find one that works well for you."

23390,"I was leaning towards iud, but she was really pushing nexplanon."
23391,My understanding was that nexplanon worked differently than the iud and had potential for more side effects.
23392,She told me they work the same way.
23393,Im very torn now and dont know what to do.
23394,Any advice from people that have tried either of these other options?

23396,"I used the Nexplanon for three years, and it didn't impact my libido, skin, or weight."

23398,"Although Nexplanon and the Mirena IUD function similarly, the Mirena IUD contains only 52 micrograms, which decreases to 21 micrograms after 24 days, while the implant has 68 micrograms and decreases further after a year of use."

23402,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
23403,Hello!
23404,First time reddit user here.
23405,I wanted to know if anybody had or has had a similar experience to mine.
23406,"Im female 22, and went off birth control 2ish years ago."
23407,I had been on it since I was 12 because of ovarian cysts and terrible periods among other things.
23408,"I have never had a regular cycle, especially given the fact that I got my first period shortly after my 7th birthday."
23409,"However, 2 years ago I decided to stop taking it because I wanted to get off all meds (bc, anti depressants, anxiety meds, etc.)"
23410,"and I very very quickly, and I mean in the span of 3 monthsgained about 3040lbs and also got adult acne which is insane because I never had acne in my early or late teens."
23411,The change was drastic and very noticiable given that Im 411 and always weighed somewhere around 100115lbs.
23412,"I am just as active as Ive always been, gym 23x a week, have the same appetite/eating habits and pretty much same everything."
23413,"This has been so detrimental to my mental health and confidence, especially since I watch what I eat and exercise regularly but cant seem to put off more that 5lbs that Ill just gain right back anyway."
23414,Its frustrating more than anything.
23415,"I dont care about what other people look like, Im no one to judge but I do not feel my best at the moment with my weight."
23416,I feel awful and I just want to hide.
23417,Its even more frustrating hearing people tell me that I just need to eat better and exercise more or that its because Im lazy and yada yada.
23418,Its especially frustrating when its coming from a doctor that right off the bat is assuming its due to poor eating habits and activity.
23419,The only thing Ive ever really gotten from my doctor is a picture of a food groups chart and orders to walk at least 30mins a day.
23420,Any advice?
23421,Should I push my doctor harder to run tests?
23422,Should I switch doctors?
23423,Go straight to a gyno?
23424,Endocrinologist?
23425,Any advice or experience would help so much.
23426,"Its possible your appetite increased off of birth control, and you are unconsciously eating a higher quantity if your usual food items because of increased hunger."
23427,Its easy as hell to do and not notice.
23428,This is also a reason why ppl who go on birth control can gain weight.
23429,Its definitely worth getting your thyroid checked!
23430,If you have PCOS its often harder for people with PCOS to lose weight and birth control was suppressing that.
23431,"You didnt have acne in your early teens but you were also on birth control, so it doesnt really mean anything you dont know what your body would have been like off birth control."
23432,This is not a just eat better and move more situation and it isnt your fault.
23433,My bet is that the birth control was suppressing PCOS symptoms.
23434,Honestly that sounds like you might have PCOS that your birth control was unknowingly treating.
23435,"The weight, the acne, the weird periods, and cysts."
23436,I would find a new doctor and start asking about it.
23437,Birth control does not have long term side effects but it can mask the symptoms of other things and any issues you had before can always come back.
23438,Echoing what others were saying.
23439,Sounds like bc was suppressing a hormonal imbalance you naturally have.
23440,Natural and medfree isnt better.
23441,"Sure, we can make lifestyle changes to improve some things  for instance, exercise is great for anxiety and depression."
23442,"But before bc and meds women used to suffer horribly from hormonal issues and it was just how things were.In the past Ive made the mistake of trying to go med free and it sucks lmao, meds are great."
23443,"Yeah I would definitely have the thyroid checked like the other commenter said, along with a hormone panel.If it is pcos, there are other ways to treat if you don't want to get back on hbc."
23444,Metformin and inositol are a couple options I know have worked for others.
23445,Forgot to add!
23446,Could this possibly be a side effect of long term bc use?

23450,Please contact the moderators of this subreddit(/message/compose/?to/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.
23451,Ive been seeing that online!
23452,"I think its because when we see PCOS online, we see the extreme cases and maybe mine could just be mild."
23453,Who knows.
23454,I dont know anything about it to be really honest.
23455,"Your post has been removed from /r/birthcontrol after user reports, as it was determined to be spam."

23457,A couple links that go a bit more in depth with it.
23458,I would recommend finding a gynecologist and bringing up your symptoms.
23459,If they suspect it they will likely send you to a endocrinologist.
23460,I (22f) have been on Nexplanon since March.
23461,Recently(last 3 weeks) me and my partner (26m) have been having unprotected sex as I was reassured by my OB that Nexplanon is one of the most effect forms of birth control.
23462,"For the last few days Ive been experiencing a lot of nausea(specifically around the same time everyday), cramping, tender breasts, and gas."
23463,Any chance I could be pregnant or do yall think maybe its just side effects changing?Ive got MAJOR anxiety and Im a bit of a hypochondriac so Im not sure if maybe Im thinking too much or if theres a chance I could be pregnant.
23464,I dont know much about it but I did read you can get symptoms as early as 10 days and are the ones I listed which jump started my worry LOLIm also unsure when I can test as I dont get my periods anymore due to the Nexplanon.Any suggestions?
23465,Nexplanon is practically bulletproof.
23466,Its the most effective form of birth control on the market.
23467,"There are very very very very very few recorded cases of pregnancy on it and I remember one girl who posted here who did get pregnant on it, well she became a case study because its that rare."
23468,"Majority of the time pregnancies on nexplanon are from the dang thing never even getting into your arm than anything.If you can feel it in your arm you are perfectly fine, sometimes side effects of birth control happen at any time, while Im on a different type of birth control.. like on my pill I randomly get hot flashes or I get emotional."
23469,The side effects can happen wheneverTo ease your mind just take a test once a month on months you are sexually active and see the negatives.
23470,That way you can gain trust in that tiny little rod in your arm.The odds are in your favor in this

23475,Nexplanon is more effective than a vasectomy.
23476,Its much more likely that anxiety is making you hyper aware of hormonal side effects and aggravating them.
23477,Okay thank you!Definitely helped reassure me about this.
23478,Ill wait a while and if things persist Ill test just to calm the anxiety.I could be experiencing these things because of the anxiety alone haha

23487,"Thanks, just learnt that minipills dont include inactive ones!"
23488,And ya know what thats good for me to know too because Im thinking of switching to the mini pill lol
23489,I also just learnt that Cerazette can be taken within a 12 hour time frame.
23490,"So theres a LOT less chance of taking it late, damn still wont risk it but its nice to know its that long"
23491,"Tldr I (Fem, 18) got my first ever Depo shot 26 days ago."
23492,The gap between my depo shot and my last unprotected sexual contact is 14 days.
23493,I am also currently 8 days on lowdose combined birth control pills on top of that.
23494,"3 days ago, my nipples got sore, and I'm extremely scared that I'm pregnant."
23495,"(This is a very quick summary, there's a lot more to it)If extra details aren't your thing, I've enclosed the important parts in  brackets  for your convenience."
23496,"Full explanation 26 days ago, I got myself injected with DepoLyndavel by someone from a local family planning organization, and right after she injected me, she asked me to hold and push a piece of cotton against the injection site then move the cotton in a circular motion."
23497,I did what she said with a bit more pressure on the injection site.
23498,I massaged it for around 710 minutes.
23499,"Really trusted in my depo at that time, so 12 days ago, i let my boyfriend come inside me twice."
23500,The next day I found out you're not supposed to massage it because apparently it speeds up absorption and so the effects will no longer last as long and its effectiveness will decrease (not sure about this part).
23501,I did the Yuzpe method the next day out of fear.
23502,"It's basically an emergency contraceptive method, kinda like Plan B."
23503,"Finally, 9 days ago I decided to use what little money I had to schedule a call with an OBGyn about my concerns."
23504,"She said massaging it was kinda okay, and considering the fact that I did the Yuzpe method as well, she said the chances of being pregnant were foggy."
23505,I also asked her if doing yuzpe was fine even though I was on depo and she said yes.
23506,"Also asked about the fact that I had probably a 38.5C fever when I did it with my partner, and if the depo shot would be less effective."
23507,She said no.
23508,"I then asked her about other things that could make depo less effective, and she just said tuberculosis and psychiatric meds could affect the depo shot."
23509,"Now I'm worried because there's been other accounts of depo users who got pregnant because of things other than the aforementioned meds like thyroid issues, hyperovulation, hormonal conditions, and the depo shot just straight up failing despite the chances being very low."
23510,The doctor mentioned none of that.
23511,I have an aunt who is a pediatrician and she has brought up once that I might have hyperthyroidism.
23512,Plus there's so many medications in the world and any interaction from them could affect depo.
23513,"My doctor said if I wasn't confident in my shot, I could take the combination birth control pills I was taking prior to my depo shot, so I bought one pack a day after calling and started on that same day."
23514,It's called Micropil Plus and its dosage is norethisterone 400 mcg and ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg.
23515,I think it's lowdose.
23516,"I've been very complacent in taking though, being 4 hours late in taking it four times already."
23517,It's because I think it's fine because of the depo.
23518,"Ironic, I know."
23519,"Suddenly, three days ago, my nipples started feeling sore."
23520,"It's noticeable while wearing a bra, like it's a bit ticklish or occasionally itchy, but I can take a shower comfortably and all that."
23521,"But when pinching them, it's very very clear that they're sore because they're more sensitive than usual."
23522,Today I've also noticed a small dull ache above my left breast next to my armpit that reaches over to my deltoid area.
23523,I've been on my pills for 4 months and I've never ever had sore nipples before.
23524,"Took two pregnancy tests today and both came out negative, but it's only been 12 days so it's still too early to be sure  Now I am VERY worried because I know sore nipples are a very common side effect of pregnancy."
23525,I'm also starting to doubt my OBGyn.
23526,Am I pregnant?
23527,Or is it because of the depo or pills?
23528,"If it's too early to tell that I'm expecting, can I assume that if my sore nipples get worse or stay for a long time, it means I'm pregnant?"
23529,How long is it staying for?
23530,"And lastly, what are the chances that I'm pregnant?"
23531,To make the timeline easierJuly 27  second to the last sexual contact (unprotected).
23532,August 12  unusually very light breakthrough bleeding from placebo pills.
23533,August 14  depo shot.
23534,August 27  negative pregnancy test.
23535,August 28  boyfriend finished in me two times.
23536,August 29  did the yuzpe method.
23537,September 1  started combination pills and negative pregnancy test.
23538,September 6  nipples got sore (mild to moderate).
23539,September 9  two negative pregnancy tests and the day of posting this post.NOTESIt's very unlikely that I was pregnant prior to 11 days ago.
23540,"I had a negative pregnancy test before my most recent sexual contact, and my second most recent sexual contact was a month before said test."
23541,"I also took a test 7 days ago and it came out negative.I also don't have any other side effects at the time of posting this except for being short of breath and having tired legs after climbing 3 flights of stairs, but maybe that's just because I haven't worked out in a while and have a 2 week cough."
23542,I just walked half a kilometer today and I don't feel like lying down on the ground unlike other people who have fatigue as a pregnancy symptom.Closing messageI'm sorry if I'm very paranoid to the point that it's ridiculous.
23543,I just absolutely can't afford being pregnant since abortion isn't allowed in my country and I'm not in college yet and want to work on a stable career first.
23544,Also if I got pregnant my parents would kill me and the people around me will look with absolute disgust since my country is very conservative and look down on and make fun of teenage/young pregnancies.
23545,Basically my life would be over before it even started.
23546,I hope you understand.
23547,Youre not pregnant.
23548,Youre nipples are sore from ALL the hormones.
23549,You know youre fine try your best to relax!!!
23550,You can take a blood test for extra reassurance itll be negative as well.

23594,"Hi, I am 25 !"
23595,I been taking Chateal Eq for about 6 months already and for me the first 2 months were a bit of a rollercoaster ride of side effects.
23596,"I would feel nauseous, irritated, and out of tune i would say with my own body."
23597,Then the symptoms started to subside and my body adjusted to the hormones.
23598,"However, the side effects would be off and on for me."
23599,"Like just slight nipple pain like if they rubbed against uncomfortable fabric, and a small headache here and there, as well as slight back pain."
23600,"Basically pms, as if you werent on the pill and it happens about a week before my placebo week."
23601,For me my cramping is so much less during the withdrawal bleeds.
23602,I get my period starting the 2nd day of my placebo week.
23603,"This is my overall experience, hopefully it goes well for you !"
23604,"I literally just caught this as I never really compared the two, but is there a difference between plan B and this combined birth control?"
23605,I am big and Ive always heard plan b is less effective bc of the weight limit.
23606,The last time I was at my gyno I asked if there was a weight limit for me in terms of birth control bc I was concerned being over a specific weight might mean its less effective for me and she said that wasnt the case bc there wasnt enough evidence to show that.
23607,But I just noticed one ingredient in my birth control is the same as plan b and Im now worried it might not work bc of my weight?
23608,Ive been taking this specific one for well over a year probably and I havent had any pregnancies but still.
23609,Thoughts?
23610,There is a difference between a one time dose and a medicine that is designed to be taken over the course of time.
23611,As far as I know the only birth control with a weight limit is the patch.
23612,"Pills do not fall under this, plan b does but the pills themselves dont fall under this."
