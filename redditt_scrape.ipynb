       "\" [For those needing emergency assistance please use the Chat Available Here](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/online-tools/chat)\\n\\n**If your birth control failed or was incorrectly taken within the last five days, you have several Emergency Contraception options:**\\n\\n  - **[Copper IUD](https://bedsider.org/features/110-the-emergency-contraceptive-that-keeps-going-and-going)**: The Copper IUD is the most effective EC (99% effective), if placed within five days of unprotected sex. [Unfortunately there are myths about IUDs.](https://bedsider.org/features/243-5-myths-about-the-iud-busted) If you have a higher BMI, the Copper IUD is your best choice as the other methods are less effective for women with a higher BMIs. [Cost? In the USA 100% covered by insurance](https://www.paragard.com/cost-insurance-coverage/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=USA_GO_SEM_NB_PH_Paragard-DTC-NBMessaging&utm_term=iud+cost&utm_content=IUD_Cost&gclid=Cj0KCQiA5NSdBhDfARIsALzs2ED34GXUmi78pqxHGRkmvtrHYywbSepHgO0xPS1Rh32W6z_lUCxQqr0aAjMzEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)\\n\\n - *New evidence shows a hormonal IUD can also be used as emergency contraception in addition to the copper IUD, but please ask your doctor for their advice. Be cautious, as it is a newer EC option.* \\n\\n  -  **Plan B**: This method is most effective when used within 72 hours after having unprotected sex, however, the sooner the better. It is available over the counter or online without a prescription in many countries. It is a high dose of progestin which will prevent ovulation. Please note, studies have found that women with a BMI over 25 had an increased risk of a pregnancy when using Plan B. \\n\\n     - [Cost at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/509481545)\\n\\n     - [Cost at Amazon](https://a.co/d/2xSxtp2)\\n\\n     - The FDA said since Plan B prevents pregnancy by acting on ovulation, “well before implantation,” it does not cause abortions.  Tldr: It only prevents ovulation and does not prevent implantation. See: [FDA announcement](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/12/24/fda-changes-plan-b-packaging-to-clarify-that-it-is-not-an-abortion-pill.html)\\n\\n  -  **[Ella](https://bedsider.org/A/87-introducing-ella-a-new-emergency-contraceptive-available-in-the-u-s)**: This method is most effective when used within 5 days of unprotected sex. You will need a prescription (Planned Parenthood, Urgent Care, Emergency Room, etc) to get it, but it can also be obtained [online](https://www.prjktruby.com/products/ella/). Ella acts to suppress progesterone. Ella delays ovulation. Please note, while Ella is a better choice than Plan B for women with a higher BMI, studies have found that women with a higher BMI had an increased risk of a pregnancy when using Ella. Please also note, **Ella can make hormonal birth control less effective (as it suppresses progestin), so use a backup barrier method for at least 7 days to one month after taking it.** \\n\\n     - [Cost?](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/whats-ella-morning-after-pill)\\n\\n  - **[Yuzpe Method](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2014/0401/p545.html)**: This method is most effective when used within 72 hours after having unprotected sex. The Yuzpe method is two higher doses of regular birth control pills. By taking multiple pills in a specific order, the estrogen and progestin in those pills work to prevent ovulation. However, this method has a higher chance of side effects because it is progestin and estrogen. \\n\\n**Myths Concerning Emergency Contraception Pills:**  \\n\\n  - Does it cause an abortion? No, some people confuse Emergency Contraception Pills with abortion pills. ECPs prevent pregnancy by delaying ovulation, so nothing gets fertilized. Studies show that ECPs are not effective if a woman has already ovulated. Remember Emergency Contraception is important, in part, because sperm live in and around the fallopian tubes for days waiting for an egg to appear (around 5 days). That’s why ECPs only work for up to 5 days after sex, and why it’s important to take them as soon as you can.  \\n\\n  - Can I have unprotected sex again? No. ECPs only protect you against one act of unprotected sex. If you have unprotected sex again after taking ECPs, you’re increasing your risk of a pregnancy. \\n\\n  - Will they affect future fertility? No. There is no evidence anywhere that they affect future fertility. The main risk is unintended pregnancies as ECPs are much less effective than many other methods of birth control (IUD, Implant, Pill, etc.)  \\n\\n**But what’s MY Pregnancy Risk?**  \\n\\nIt is impossible to calculate the pregnancy risk for each individual unprotected sexual act. So we can't tell you that. But...\\n\\n - If you missed a pill, start with your specific pill instruction guide. If you lost it, many are available online. If after searching you still can't find it, [this is a short guide](https://bedsider.org/features/153-late-late-for-a-very-important-pill). The tl;dr is any missed pill near the placebo/inactive/no pills can raise your risk for pregnancy.   \\n\\n - [Bleeding](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0515/p2073.html) or [lack there of](https://www.verywell.com/withdrawal-bleeding-906612) while on hormonal birth control is not an indication of pregnancy, it is just possible side effect.   \\n\\n - If the condom broke, but you used withdrawal, then start [here.](https://bedsider.org/features/310-5-myths-about-pulling-out-busted) The tl;dr is that withdrawal can prevent pregnancy in most cases, but even withdrawal rockstars can get pregnant.   \\n\\nOnly a pregnancy test can rule out pregnancy. Typically, the most reliable way to test is to test 21 days after the unprotected sex act, and again 7 days after that. Remember, use the first pee of the day. For a link to very cheap tests, check out the example in the sidebar.\\n\\n**I'm on hormonal birthcontrol but no bleed this month?**\\n\\nAgain, [bleeding](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0515/p2073.html) or [lack there of](https://www.verywell.com/withdrawal-bleeding-906612) while on hormonal birth control is not an indication of pregnancy, it is just a possible side effect.   \\n\\nAre you on the combo pill? The monthly bleed is not a pregnancy indication. Really. it was just a *marketing tactic* to get women to try the pill in the 1970s and because one of the doctors was Catholic. Lack of a 'withdrawal bleed' (what the bleed is called) is very common because the pill thins your lining. Thin lining = less bleeding (which can even mean no bleeding). And most doctors / researchers now want the placebo pills shortened or removed altogether as they can reduce ovarian suppression (impact effectiveness). \\n\\nSo do not worry unless a mistake happened (missed pill, IUD misplacement discovered after string check, etc).\""
